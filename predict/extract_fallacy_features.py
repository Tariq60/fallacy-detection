    This script takes three inputs:
        1. A tarined fallacy recognition model (based on the T5) model. (see paper)
        2. A file with text segments (e.g., sentences), one at each line in jsonl format with a key "text" in each line.
    It outputs three files:
        1. 
        2. 
        3.
