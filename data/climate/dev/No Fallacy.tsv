“To revisit the ocean’s paleotemperatures now, we need to carefully quantify this re-equilibration, which has been overlooked for too long. For that, we have to work on other types of marine organisms so that we clearly understand what took place in the sediment over geological time”	Or use other temperature proxies to compare with the oxygen isotope data to see if they are consistent—which is what has been done for years.	
“[…]an explanation of the fluctuations of the earth’s temperatures that global warming alarmists are going to make sure to bury: The cycle of changes in the climate over the millennia is a result of changes in the amount of solar radiation, in part caused by small changes in the orbits of Earth and Mars.”	This is the accepted explanation for periodic past changes in Earth’s climate. We spend multiple classes explaining this to our students. We certainly do not bury it.	
“Sea ice has diminished much faster than scientists and climate models anticipated.”	The main take-home message is that sea ice is disappearing very fast and we know why. It’s a clear response to the fact that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are now higher than have been in at least 2 million years, mainly due to burning fossil fuels. The sea ice is a critical component of the Earth’s climate system, and losing over half of it in less than a human generation is already having repercussions well beyond the Arctic. 	article58.txt
“With such relatively clean air throughout America, how can even reputable news agencies like Reuters continue spreading the well-worn lie that the United States is one of the ‘biggest polluters’ in the world?”	America has the largest economy and the 3rd largest population on Earth. Even if each of its factories and people themselves emitted less than in most other countries, it would still add up to being one of the biggest polluters.	
“The Arctic also stores terrifying bugs from more recent times. In Alaska, already, researchers have discovered remnants of the 1918 flu that infected as many as 500 million and killed as many as 100 million”	A series of cholera pandemics and 1918 Spanish influenza were global pandemics causing high mortality long before anthropogenic climate change began influencing the geographic range of climate-sensitive health outcomes.  The World Health Organization and national health systems are preparing for changes in the intensity of transmission, geographic range, and seasonality of climate-sensitive infectious diseases.  Certainly much more needs to be done, but the article implies national and International public health organizations and institutions will not take action when diseases emerge or re-emerge.  This is not consistent with the responses to Ebola, Zika, and other recent events.	
“Mass coral bleaching is a new phenomenon and was never observed before the 1980s as global warming ramped up.”	On the Great Barrier Reef, I believe this is true. Global (especially tropical) temperatures took a jump upwards in the late 1970s, providing the extra warmth that puts corals in danger.	article42.txt
“Back in the late 1980s, the UN claimed that if global warming were not checked by 2000, rising sea levels would wash entire counties away.”	Rising seas are, in fact, forcing many Pacific island nations and coastal communities in the United States to plan for permanent evacuation. Although low-lying areas will not “disappear” into the ocean anytime soon, nuisance flooding, erosion, and storm surges are making maintaining these communities economically untenable.	article36.txt
“’Extremely remarkable’ 2017 heads toward record for hottest year without an El Niño episode.”	At the moment, it is more likely than not that 2017 will become the second warmest year of the instrumental period. The warmest was 2016 with El Niño. So this claim is correct.	
“The tropical storm, feeding off this unusual warmth, was able to progress from a tropical depression to a category-four hurricane in roughly 48 hours.”	This storm was quite remarkable in its intensification. It does seem likely that the warmth of the surface and sub-surface waters, primarily linked to variability but also with a small climate change contribution, enhanced the storm. 	article74.txt
” ‘and it’s only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models, everything else, is right off the board’ ” 	This is completely untrue. In terms of CO2 emissions, all the volcanic eruptions in the world combined put less than 1% of human CO2 emissions into the atmosphere every year. A large volcanic eruption in the tropics can cool the climate significantly for a couple of years (such as Mt Pinatubo in 1991) but climate models capture this extremely well.	
“But the differences between NOAA and NASA aren’t that significant, Schmidt further argued, in the context of the bigger picture. ‘Getting hung up on the exact nature of the records is interesting, and there’s lots of technical work that can be done there, but the main take-home response there is that the trends we’ve been seeing since the 1970s are continuing and have not paused in any way,’ he said.”	Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center for Atmospheric Research: This section accurately portrays the overall context of the 2016 record, and the fact that the modest differences between datasets do not change the “big picture” conclusion that the Earth is warming and that 2016 was an extraordinary year even in that context. 	
as time progresses and fossil fuel emissions increase, the number of record highs should increase and record lows should decrease. 	In fact, globally, record daily high temperatures are outpacing record daily lows. This is even also the case over the relatively small region of the globe we call the US. See, for example, this Climate Central article.	article124.txt
” ‘You see, gas in America is incredibly cheap, because of fracking,’ he says. But what about the risk of triggering earthquakes? He rolls his eyes.”	There is a big misconception about the trigger of recent earthquakes in Oklahoma. Fracking in the United States has been used for several decades. However, the disposal of waste water into the subsurface has been directly linked to the recent earthquakes in Oklahoma. A quick google scholar search on “Oklahoma earthquakes” will bring up numerous articles that demonstrate this point. My family has lived in Oklahoma for decades and I can tell you first-hand that the increase in number of >3.0 magnitude earthquakes is unprecedented in the past 8 years.	
“The most frequently-used range of estimates puts the likely range between 15-25cm (6-10in) above 1992 levels by 2030, and 79-155cm (31-61in) by 2100.”	It is true that these are commonly used projections in this region. This statement refers to the Unified Sea Level Rise Projection that was produced by the Southeast Florida Regional Compact on Climate Change.	article56.txt
“Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming, the continent’s ice was in relative balance”	Yes. Research suggests that the ice sheet was likely near balance up until close to the turn of the 21st century.	article82.txt
Scientists such as Dr Willie Soon, a solar astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, have shown that as water vapour rises, so does temperature. It is why cloudless nights are so chilly.	The water vapor feedback is one of the main positive feedbacks in the climate system. It has been well understood for much of the century that increased temperatures will increase the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, trapping additional heat. This is by no means a controversial topic in the scientific community, fringe views by Willie Soon notwithstanding. Water vapor cannot be a forcing because of its extremely short atmospheric lifetime in the troposphere. Adding a bunch of additional water vapor won’t cause long-term changes, at it will quickly precipitate out. However, the absolute amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is strongly determined by the temperature; warm the planet (e.g. by increasing CO2 concentrations) and you will end up with more water vapor in the air. This is why water vapor is a feedback rather than a forcing. This RealClimate post provides some good background on the role of water vapor as a climate feedback.	
Temperatures in the Southwest increased by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) from 1901 to 2010, and some climate models forecast a total rise of six degrees or more by the end of this century.	I checked various sources and these numbers are about right, an increase of almost 2 °F, or +0.17/decade1. Annual temperatures in New Mexico are projected to rise another 3.5 to 8.5°F by 21002. 1-Tebaldi et al (2012) The heat is on: U.S. temperature trends, Climate Central 2-NOAA Technical Report NESDIS 142-5 (2013) Regional Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment.

“Sea ice thickness also substantially declined in the latter half of the 20th century, the snow and ice data center said.”	Agree—and adding how we don’t know much about Antarctic sea ice thickness would have been helpful.	article47.txt
“Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050, the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn’t happen. Rather, global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved.”	This is nonsense. No polar bear scientist has predicted a drop in polar bear abundance based on summer sea ice. We base the assessment of loss on duration of the ice-free period. Papers1,2 from our research group assess this point. The statement about global polar bear numbers is absolutely unfounded. It is a contrived statement using population estimates provided so that children (or the general public) could give a number of polar bears in the world for school reports and the like. Castro de la Guarida1 states, “Sea ice across the Arctic is declining and altering physical characteristics of marine ecosystems. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) have been identified as vulnerable to changes in sea ice conditions. We use sea ice projections for the Canadian Arctic Archipelago from 2006 – 2100 to gain insight into the conservation challenges for polar bears with respect to habitat loss using metrics developed from polar bear energetics modeling. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Shifts away from multiyear ice to annual ice cover throughout the region, as well as lengthening ice-free periods, may become critical for polar bears before the end of the 21st century with projected warming. Each polar bear population in the Archipelago may undergo 2-5 months of ice-free conditions, where no such conditions exist presently. We identify spatially and temporally explicit ice-free periods that extend beyond what polar bears require for nutritional and reproductive demands. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Under business-as-usual climate projections, polar bears may face starvation and reproductive failure across the entire Archipelago by the year 2100.” Both of these studies1,2 assess the threat to polar bears based on projected sea ice loss over the next 3 generations (ca. 33-45 years). It is an issue of fasting duration that causes polar bear population declines and this is well understood in the published literature. Dr. Crockford is following the standard climate change denier approach of picking on a specific detail and then contriving an unsubstantiated fictional account on that point. Loss of sea ice in summer is, by and large, irrelevant. It’s the duration of the ice-free period that matters. If not, polar bears in Hudson Bay would have disappeared hundreds or thousands of years ago but they didn’t because they used to be able to obtain sufficient fat stores while hunting seals on the sea ice in spring. The situation is changing but the best estimate is that we’ll have significant declines in the Western Hudson Bay population (beyond the current ca. 30% decline) by mid-century. By repeating it often enough, it appears that deniers or the uninformed think there’s some merit to the issue Dr. Crockford has raised. Nobody can scientifically rebut the flawed thesis because it isn’t published. My understanding was that the manuscript was rejected by scientific journals so now Dr. Crockford’s manuscript languishes as an unreviewed “Preprint” in PeerJ and she erroneously calls it a “paper”. 1- Castro de la Guardia et al (2013) Future sea ice conditions in western Hudson Bay and consequences for polar bears in the 21st century, Global Change Biology 2- Regehr et al (2016) Conservation status of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in relation to projected sea-ice declines, Biology Letters 	article94.txt
“‘Arctic ice conditions have been tracking at record low conditions since October, persisting for six consecutive months’”	Timothy Osborn, Professor, University of East Anglia, and Director of Research, Climatic Research Unit: Yes, this is supported by the observations, available at the NSIDC website. 	
Most of the atmospheric moisture originates in the tropical ocean, and the difference between surface and upper atmospheric temperature determines how much of the moisture rises into the atmosphere. 	Satellite-observed increases in atmospheric moisture content agree with satellite datasets that show more warming.1 1- Mears et al (2015) Intercomparison of total precipitable water measurements made by satellite-borne microwave radiometers and ground-based GPS instruments, Journal of Geophysical Research	article130.txt
“The world’s alpine glaciers recorded a net annual loss of ice for the 36th consecutive year and the Greenland ice sheet … experienced melting over more than 50% of its surface.”	That is correct, see figure below: There was an event in the beginning of July when ~50% of the ice sheet experienced melt. This is clearly outside of the expected natural variability, but does not necessarily project the overall Greenland summer (since such melt events are extremely episodic). Overall, Greenland experienced a warm summer, with slightly more surface runoff than average and overall average amounts of snowfall (source)

“Can the “uncertainty monster” in climate research, and particularly climate modeling, be acknowledged?”	A quick look through the IPCC assessment reports reveals long discussions about uncertainty in our understanding and climate prediction. Moreover, uncertainty in global warming projection exists mainly at the high end—toward more warming—for simple physical reasons.	
“the climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming ‘hiatus’”	Recent media headlines have again discussed the issue of whether climate models are overly sensitive to greenhouse gases. These headlines have misinterpreted a study by Millar et al. which was discussing carbon budgets to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. A recent study by Medhaug et al. analysed the issue of how the models have performed against recent observations at length and largely reconciled the issue. An overly simplistic comparison of simulated global temperatures and observations might suggest that the models were warming too much, but this would be wrong for a number of reasons. In the Medhaug et al. paper they show the range of models (blue shading in figure with median in light blue), compared with the HadCRUT4 observations and their estimated uncertainty (orange shading with light orange line). There are a number of well understood reasons why the light orange line might not follow the light blue line, namely: radiative forcings, variability, observational biases and choice of reference period.

“Can the “uncertainty monster” in climate research, and particularly climate modeling, be acknowledged?”	The scientific community has been scrupulously careful to report uncertainties in terms of “likely” or “confidence”. The planet has warmed; that is unequivocal. Humans have contributed; that is more than 95% assured. See: IPCC 5th Assessment Report	
Dr Willie Soon’s comparison of temperature data and water vapour [Figure]	This follows the physical expectation that water vapour scales with temperature. The temperature change is driving the changes in water vapour (maintaining quasi-constant relative humidity) and not vice-versa. So they are correlated but for precisely the opposite reason than is being reported here. 	
Climate projections also assume that planet Earth is not dynamic	This is nonsense. The models assume that physics works and just implement equations in a way that computers can munch through them. This makes them imperfect, but this statement shows complete cluelessness about models or physics.	
“Last year’s warmth was manifested across the planet, from the warm tropical ocean waters off the coast of northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef experienced its worst coral bleaching event on record and large scale coral death, to the Arctic, where sea ice hit regular monthly record lows and overall temperatures were also the warmest on record, at least from January through September 2016.”	Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center for Atmospheric Research: This section accurately describes major 2016 events that occurred in the Earth system, and which most likely would not have occurred without global warming.	article46.txt
“We have known for decades that increasing CO₂ and precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener – by the end of the century, it is likely that global biomass will have increased by forty percent.”	In short, the negative effect of climate change is expected to largely offset the positive effect of increasing CO2.

“Dr. Serreze said that such a situation, which would leave nothing but open ocean in summer until fall freeze-up begins, could occur by 2030, although many scientists say it may not happen for a decade or two after that.”	2030 is on the early side of ice-free predictions but definitely not out of the realm of possibility.	article89.txt
“This will achieve almost nothing. My peer-reviewed research, published last November in the journal Global Policy, shows that even if every nation were to fulfill all their carbon-cutting promises by 2030 and stick to them all the way through the century—at a cost of more than $100 trillion in lost GDP—global temperature rise would be reduced by a tiny 0.3°F (0.17°C).” 	The last IPCC report makes it very clear that following a path of strong emissions reductions can indeed cap warming at 2C or less, while business as usual would see 4-5C of warming this century. It is also now clear that meeting the Paris targets will likely save the West Antarctic ice sheet from melting, while other scenarios would see many metres of sea level rise, effectively destroying many of the major cities of the world. The costs of such inaction are almost incalculable.	
“We simply cannot afford an agreement that puts thousands of Americans out of work[…]”	See above for why it is misleading to say that Americans would be put out of work. Some Americans would be put out of work, while new jobs would open up for others. On net, most evidence suggests that there would be job growth, rather than a decline in jobs.
