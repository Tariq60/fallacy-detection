('“But there’s reason to think Thwaites and Pine Island could go even faster than Jakobshavn.”', 'I don’t think we know this yet, and the author doesn’t really back up this claim. The topography beneath Jakobshavn extends to great depths (more than 1 km) for several tens of kilometres upstream of the current calving front (see this recent study by An et al, 2017*). This type of geometry may allow for rapid retreat without any extra push from a warming climate. Thwaites and Pine Island are completely different beasts—the sheer scale and the sea-level equivalent they contain is what’s troublesome with these two.

('paints a far more dire picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought', 'This statement and similar statements would benefit from specific examples from the report or more context. Although I agree the problem is dire, I’m not sure which aspect of the problem is worse than previously thought. For example, the carbon budget (i.e., how much humans can emit and still warm less than 1.5 degrees C) has expanded from previous estimates. It may be that some impacts will be felt earlier or will be worse than previously estimated—this just wasn’t clearly articulated. Other statements that I thought could have used greater context or examples from the report include the quote by Bill Hare (below), or the statement that “the new report, however, shows that many of those effects will come much sooner, at the 2.7-degree mark.”')
('“The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm”', 'A reference here would have been useful as it’s unclear exactly where this number comes from. We know that human-caused climate change can increase both the moisture content of the atmosphere, as described by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, and the energetics of the storm, as there is increased latent heat release. Both of these climate change-influenced drivers have the potential to cause increased precipitation.')
('“while it’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s, there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice.”', 'We know that polar bears depend on the ice surface to catch their prey. We know that increasing numbers of ice free days have resulted in poorer body condition in some areas (e.g. Southern Beaufort, Western and Southern Hudson Bay), we know that poorer cub survival has followed both declining ice and poorer body condition, and all the evidence suggests these things are linked. Perhaps this is not “proof” that less available summer ice is the cause (correlation does not necessarily imply causation), but I am not aware of evidence for any other explanation. And I don’t think the female polar bears are intentionally having cubs but not feeding them.')
('“Falsified and sure-to-be-falsified exaggerations from a parade of Ph.D. scientists”', 'The author does not provide any evidence of “falsified” scientific reports of climate predictions or observations. ')
('“When someone says, ‘climate science is settled,’ remind them to check the facts.”', 'This statement highlights the major problem with this article. The authors do not support their claims with scientific references and data. Their logic is flawed and does not take into account basic scientific theories that explain, for example, the role of certain gases in causing a greenhouse effect and the negative impacts of high levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. […] So based on this statement and the lack of scientific references in this article, readers should be prompted to disregard the majority of claims it presents.')
('“Before the end of this century, 80% of the world’s population would be wiped out.”', 'The late Stephen Schneider, one of the giants of modern climate science, once said that in his opinion “the ‘end of the world’ and ‘good for you’ are the two lowest probability outcomes” when discussing climate change. Lovelock seems to be swapping from one extreme largely unsupported by the bulk of existing scientific evidence to the opposite. In reality, our best evidence suggests that unmitigated climate change would be very detrimental to society (and the natural world), but that we can address it through difficult concerted action. The worst potential outcomes of climate change occur in scenarios where CO2 triples relative to pre-industrial levels, and while we still have a long way to go, the actions that countries around the world committed to in Paris will help avoid some of the most disastrous outcomes.')
('Sadly, these supposed experts use mathematical equations that do not jibe with reality over the past 140 years.', 'I would like to see the authors to provide the “mathematical equations” to which they refer.')
