('“For what appears to be the first time since scientists began keeping track, sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic are at record lows this time of year.”', 'While we have a very clear picture of the sea ice concentration only over the satellite era (1979-present) there are other measurements available that are more or less direct, ranging from whaling and shipping log books (showing higher sea ice extent over the past 100 years) to paleo-climate reconstruction (proxies) over thousands to million of years. [more about ‘polar amplification’ in past climate]')
('“Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude, but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode.”', 'Many people in the glaciology community are working to improve computer models of ice sheet change. I actually think that many scientists already felt that humans should be in “emergency mode”. For reference, consider the “World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity”, first written in 1992 and reprised this year. But I agree that the possibility of marine ice-cliff instability raised another alarm bell. ')
('“That isn’t all that ocean acidification can do. Carbon absorption can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more “anoxic,” first in deep ocean “dead zones,” then gradually up toward the surface[…]This process, in which dead zones grow like cancers, choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries, is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia, where hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out of the sea along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as the ‘Skeleton Coast.’”', 'Ocean acidification per se doesn’t enhance anoxia: anoxia (loss of oxygen) results from warming (warm water holds less dissolved gas like oxygen), which would be the consequence of atmospheric CO2 buildup, as might more sluggish ocean mixing. It also is enhanced by increased nutrient delivery to the ocean from more rain and river flow on land under the warmer climate. More nutrients mean more algae growth in the uppermost ocean, more decaying organic matter below the surface, and thus less oxygen. Low oxygen zones would spread as the ocean became warmer and river flow increased as the event progressed. When oxygen is exhausted, bacteria do “breathe” other oxygen-containing compounds including sulfate and respire hydrogen sulfide. The coast of Namibia does experience these extreme conditions episodically, but such conditions are unlikely to spread globally until centuries to millennia of warming and eutrophication have occurred. Hydrogen sulfide likely contributed to the mass extinction, but the warming itself as well as other volcanic emanations like chlorine, fluorine, and sulfur dioxide were equally if not more important drivers of the extinction. The recovery from the extinction did take millions of years.')
('water vapour has been the main greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide has had a minuscule effect on global climate', 'It is true that water vapour is a main greenhouse gas, but the amount of water vapour is also tightly related to temperatures (and should therefore be seen as an enhancing feedback, not a driver). That is, higher CO2 will increase temperatures, which will increase water vapour, which will increase temperatures… To write that “carbon dioxide has had a minuscule effect on global climate” is of course utter nonsense—see other comments.')
('“How did a wet Western winter lead to a sky-choking summer? The answer lies in the summer’s record-breaking heat, say wildfire experts. Days of near-100-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West in early July, and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in early August.”', 'Exceptionally high summer air temperatures undoubtedly contributed to the extensive forest fire activity that occurred during the summer of 2017 in the western United States. Forest flammability is affected by both winter snowfall and seasonal rain, as well as by spring and summer air temperatures that regulate the timing of snowmelt and how much water the atmosphere will suck out of the forest.')
('“What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.)”', 'Again, this assumes that all variables are independent and everything is happening randomly. This is just not the case. Winds, temperatures, pressures, cloud formation, and so on are all bound together in coherent ways by the laws of physics.')
('“The end of food”', 'This is hyperbole.\xa0Yes there are threats to crop production and other aspects of food security, but the scientific analyses do not suggest an actual “end of food”—it is more a case of regional winners and losers. Not all current food-producing regions are projected to lose their productivity. A redistribution of production would still still be a major issue that society will need to deal with, and may well require growing crops in new places, but this is not the same as suggesting that food supplies will completely come to an end.')
('at the end of recent ice ages, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise only after temperatures began to climb.', 'his is misleading. The way it is written incorrectly suggests that warming simply causes an increase in atmospheric CO2. The author has not acknowledged the positive feedback whereby as the Earth warms, the ocean releases more carbon to the atmosphere, reinforcing the warming.')
