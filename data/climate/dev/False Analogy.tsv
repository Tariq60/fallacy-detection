“Already, scientists know enough to be concerned. About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades. The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked.”	Although factually correct, the information provided is not sufficient to convey the relevance of sea level during this previous warm period (the previous interglacial) to the current global warming situation. It is not directly analogous because of differences in the Earth’s orbit and the long timescale during which the ice sheet melt was exposed to the warmer temperatures. IPCC AR5 WGI Summary for Policy Makers section B4 notes these two relevant issues: “This change in sea level occurred in the context of different orbital forcing and with high-latitude surface temperature, averaged over several thousand years, at least 2°C warmer than present”.

“Without human intervention, the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7,000 parts per million (ppm) in prior eras, whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm.”	A CO2 concentration of 7000 ppm is a model estimate (not observations) for the Cambrian, about 500 million years ago. There are obviously no measures of temperature for that time, but estimates from models are about 10°C (18°F) warmer than present day! Not exactly reassuring news…
“So far this month, there have been nearly 5,000 daily record highs set or tied, compared to just 42 daily record lows.”	It is very appropriate to look at this ratio of record highs versus record lows, as the climate stations themselves have different periods of records and therefore different expected rates of records (all are “long term” and have at least 30 years of data but some have much longer periods of record). But, one would still expect a one-to-one ratio of record highs to record lows in a stationary climate regime.
Like countless other organ­isms, we move and adapt when the environment changes. Species thrive when it is warm.	The rate of change is important. CO2 concentrations and temperatures are changing at an unprecedented rate, which will make it impossible for many organisms to “move and adapt”
“The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer, Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World, his new history of the planet’s major extinction events, the oceans were hundreds of feet higher.”	I don’t know what time period the author is referring to here, but closer to us, during the last interglacial (roughly 120,000 years ago), Earth was ~2 °C warmer than temperatures in the 19th century, and sea levels were about 5-6 meters higher. This suggests that even “good-case, 2 °C” long-term warming in our future could also raise oceans by that much eventually, even if the pace of that rise (and thus the amount of rise by 2100) is uncertain.
