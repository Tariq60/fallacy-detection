“One key effect will be albedo feedback”	Albedo is one effect, but it is moderated by cloud cover and only is effective during summer (winter gives dark “polar nights”). Other – perhaps equally important – factors involve the effect open sea has on exchange of moisture, the way temperature varies with height, cloud cover …	article33.txt
“But recent examples from other regions, like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea, an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland, too.”	Regarding ice shelf stability, it is important to acknowledge (which the author didn’t do here) there are different processes at work on the Antarctic Peninsula, where the Larsen ice shelves reside(d), than on the Amundsen coast (Pine Island and Thwaites ice shelves). The Larsen A and B ice shelves were very thin, and have disintegrated from percolating surface meltwater (hydrofracturing) creating vertical cracks in the ice shelf. Larsen C is thicker and larger, but is also characterised by a relatively warm climate (many melt episodes in summer) and low snowfall (which makes it vulnerable to atmospheric warming). The ice shelves that buttress the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers are much thicker, annual snowfall rates are very large, and surface melt rates are substantially lower than on the (former) Larsen ice shelves (3-5 times lower). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that surface-based ice shelf instability will occur within the next few decades—instead, these ice shelves would likely thin through contact with warmer oc	article82.txt
“Instrumental temperature measurements over the past 150 years show no correlation between human emissions of CO2 and ­temperature.”	Plotting the relationship between global temperature and the logarithm of atmospheric CO2 concentration shows a strong relationship (figure below). This is predicted by physics* since CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Ian Plimer might be confusing CO2 emissions and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which is what matters for explaining Earth’s surface temperature.
