“The study is the product of a large group of Antarctic experts who collectively reviewed 24 recent measurements of Antarctic ice loss, reconciling their differences to produce the most definitive figures yet on changes in Antarctica.”	This sounds like there are only 24 data points, but the data going into the analysis is much more extensive than this, encompassing 24 types of measurements and analysis methodologies for the period from 1992 through to 2017.
“there are alarming stories every day, like last month’s satellite data showing the globe warming, since 1998, more than twice as fast as scientists had thought”	I would like to add that this “twice as fast” is just for a cherry-picked period. That is about as bad as mitigation sceptics claiming that global warming has stopped by cherry picking a specific period. The real message was that satellite upper air warming estimates are unreliable (still are), but seem to confirm what we know from the surface warming. This story was thus not alarming. If anything is was good news, it reduces uncertainties and as this uninhabitable-article already suggests: uncertainty is not our friend.
“The report confidently claims that when temperatures rise, “the reduction in premature deaths from cold are expected to be smaller than the increase in deaths from heat in the United States.” Six footnotes are attached to that statement.”	The report says “The decrease in deaths and illness due to reductions in winter cold have not been as well studied as the health impacts of increased heat, but the reduction in premature deaths from cold are expected to be smaller than the increase in deaths from heat in the United States“. This doesn’t sound over-confident to me; and as for the “footnotes”, there are scientific references to back up that claim, not asterisks leading to fine-print caveats… 
“In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon.”	It depends on the type of event. heatwaves and extreme heat events have increased since at least the 1950s1. Though tropical cyclones and drought are a bit harder to analyse since natural climate variability also plays a large role. This means there may be a signal of change due to human activity, but is more difficult to measure, due to the noise of the natural variability of the climate. Also, “attribution” can be done for specific events. this basically compares how often an extreme event of a particular magnitude and duration occurs in climate model simulations both with and without human emissions of greenhouse gases. This was first done on the 2003 European heatwave2. So it can be done, but is heavily dependent to the event you analyse, the spacial scale on which it occurs, and even the climate model/s and experimental set up you use3 1- Perkins (2012) Increasing frequency, intensity and duration of observed global heatwaves and warm spells.

“According to a recent National Economic Research Associates Economic Consulting study, the Paris Agreement could obliterate $3 trillion of GDP, 6.5 million industrial sector jobs and $7,000 in per capita household income from the American economy by 2040. Meeting the 2025 emissions reduction target alone could subtract $250 billion from our GDP and eliminate 2.7 million jobs. The cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining industries could see their production cut by 21% 19%, and 11% respectively.”	It is true that this is what the NERA study says, with many caveats. However, this statement is misleading and taken out of context. There are three reasons for this. First, and most importantly, the NERA study looked at the costs of a hypothetical set of policy actions. These may not be the actions that will be taken to comply with the Paris Agreement. One could easily model other actions with much lower costs. Second, it is only the costs that are modeled. The benefits from avoiding climate change (sea level rise, greater storm surges, greater spread of diseases, etc.) are entirely ignored. The net costs from the policies would be entirely different and likely even positive. Third, there is some cherry-picking going on here. The NERA model is known to be inflexible in how it allows for innovation to influence economic activity, and thus it tends to provide much higher cost estimates than other well-known models such as the U.S. Department of Energy’s NEMS or ICF Consulting’s IPM. The NERA model provides useful information, but it is important for it to be taken in context of model results from other models and not cherry-picked as was done here. 
“In pushing too hard for the case that global warming is universally bad for everything, the administration’s report undermines the reasonable case for climate action.”	As seems to always be the case with Lomborg (cf his previous WSJ’s article reviewed by Climate Feedback), he picks up a few studies that support his position. Note, first, that the report’s claim about projected heat-related deaths outweighing cold ones applies to the US: different regions might have different responses… Second, when reviewing the literature on the topic, the IPCC report indicates (WGIIAR5-Chap11, p.721): “it is not clear whether winter mortality will decrease in a warmer, but more variable, climate (Kinney et al., 2012; Ebi and Mills, 2013). Overall, we conclude that the increase in heat-related mortality by mid-century will outweigh gains due to fewer cold periods, especially in tropical developing countries with limited adaptive capacities and large exposed populations” So the US report does not appear wildly at odds with the literature on the topic, or to be “pushing too hard”. Also, it does not say that warming is universally bad, just that the bad outweighs the good on this particular topic.
But the heads of small island nations, fearful of rising sea levels, had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming.	The UN Report frequently demonstrated that the impacts of climate change (around the world, not just for island nations) are less severe and widespread at 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit compared to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. This would have been a useful and easy point to make, given that it was one of the central findings of this report.
“The extreme cycles of dry and wet weather appear to have been intensifying over the last three decades.”	Yes, variability in California precipitation appears to have been higher in the past 3-4 decades than the previous decades, but it is not (and cannot be) clear that that the variability in precipitation is actually currently in the act of increasing. I say that it cannot be clear because it takes decades of data (say 2-3) to characterize the current “variability” of the climate. Based on my calculations, variability in annual precipitation totals increased considerably during the second half of the 1900s and then has remained at this relatively high level for the past couple decades, but has not clearly continued to increase. This latest swing from record dry to very wet in the last year is consistent with high variability, but it’s a single event and not necessarily indicative of a trend. There are some logical links, however, that support the inference that wild swings like the current one should be expected to become more likely. First, droughts are becoming increasingly impacted by warming temperatures. Even if precipitation behavior didn’t change at all, years with low precipitation would correspond to less and less water availability for humans and ecosystems. Second, current climate models project variability of California precipitation to increase in the future, with an increase in the frequency of years with very high precipitation totals becoming detectable sometime in the first half of this century, and an increase in the frequency of years with very low precipitation totals becoming detectable in the second half of this century*. It should always be remembered, however, that models have a tough time with California precipitation. California is right on the boundary between projections of drying to the south and wetting to the north. I personally believe the basic expectation that California precipitation should become more variable, but beyond that I don’t yet put much stock in what models have to say about the future of precipitation in California. So, variability has increased overall in the last century, and this is consistent with what models project to occur as a result of greenhouse-gas driven climate change. The increase in variability hasn’t been a monotonic trend, however, and it is not obvious from the data that the trend is continuing now as rapidly as it was in previous decades. This suggests that other low-frequency processes are also at play that influence decade-to-decade changes in the variability and magnitude of annual precipitation totals, making it particularly difficult to determine the degree to which this current event can be attributed to climate change. Nonetheless, California would be wise to prepare for more events like these. Berg and Hall (2015) Increased Interannual Precipitation Extremes over California under Climate Change, Journal of Climate
“Huge sections of the Great Barrier Reef, stretching across hundreds of miles of its most pristine northern sector, were recently found to be dead, killed last year by overheated seawater.”	For validation, see our previous analysis of an article in USA Today titled “Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has worst coral die-off ever”.
“Another consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come, according to a few scientists: titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe.”	Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center for Atmospheric Research: This statement does not accurately describe an outcome that is widely supported in the scientific literature. It is certainly true that Arctic sea ice is decreasing at a rapid rate, and that further sea ice loss is highly likely in the future. It is also plausible, and supported by existing research, that present and future sea ice loss may alter the atmospheric circulation in ways that affect the likelihood of certain kinds of weather events*. But the claim regarding “Atlantic superstorms” and “hurricanes barreling across Europe” seems fairly hyperbolic. Overland et al.

“[South Australia] has the most expensive electricity in the world.”	This is misleading. It is true that prices have rapidly increased, largely due to high natural gas prices from the start-up of gas liquefaction plants. However, there are plenty of other regions within countries (note South Australia is a region within the country of Australia) with just as high or higher electricity prices. How about villages in Alaska? Small islands? This claim is just misleading.
The ‘hockey stick’ graph [Figure] 	This is a recent composite figure showing the modern PAGES2K reconstruction (in green) on top of the original MBH ’98 hockey stick graph. If the author was trying to criticize the original figure, showing a modern reconstruction that largely agrees with it is a rather odd choice.
To revisit the ocean’s paleotemperatures now, we need to carefully quantify this re-equilibration, which has been overlooked for too long. For that, we have to work on other types of marine organisms so that we clearly understand what took place in the sediment over geological time”	There are already other methods based both on different organisms and different proxy methods which the authors ignore.
I chose to assess the sea-level trend from 1915-45	It is rather ironic that the author first complains about “poor data” and then goes on to cherry-pick a time of particularly poor data that includes the World War 2 period. Even the temperature data from this period are questionable; the sea surface temperature data show a strong warm peak at the end of WW2 (the basis of his claim of 0.5 °C warming) which is probably a data collection artefact, given that no such warming is seen in the data collected at the global network of weather stations on land. Also, in the peer-reviewed literature it has been shown that minor inaccuracies in sea-level data by just a few millimeters can lead to spurious fluctuations of sea level trends when too-short time intervals are considered*.

“The most famous of these studies, published in 2010 by Paul Kench and Arthur Webb of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fiji, showed that of 27 Pacific islands, 14% lost area. Yet 43% gained area, with the rest remaining stable.”	This comment does provide a reasonable assessment of the message of our article: that the majority of islands have become larger or remained stable and that islands are locationally dynamic on their reef platforms. We think these dynamic features do pose management challenges for island communities. However, all reports fail to reflect the nuances of our work.
there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events,	It’s not clear how you judge “systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather”. Since the 2013 UN IPCC report, we have new data and analysis showing increases in extreme heat and precipitation in many areas due to human-caused global warming. It is misleading not to mention this.
“Howard Browman, a marine scientist for 35 years, has published a review in the ICES Journal of Marine Science of all the papers published on the subject.”	The article that Mr. Delingpole is referring to is not “a review”, but an introduction to a special theme issue on the topic of ocean acidification[…] The introduction does not review all of the nearly 4000 articles on the subject. Rather, it presents an overview of the sub-set of research dealing with biological/ecological effects of ocean acidification.
