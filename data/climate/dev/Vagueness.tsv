“‘Next year or the year after, the Arctic will be free of ice’”	The title is misleading. Wadhams suggests that the central Arctic (only) will be ice free in the summer.	article33.txt
“‘This El Niño might have contributed about a quarter or a third’ of the record in 2016, said Deke Arndt, chief of the global monitoring branch at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, on a press call Wednesday.”	I find this part confusing. The “percentage of the anomaly” caused by El Niño depends of course on the anomaly, which depends on the baseline. So it’s not really a useful number. El Niño caused a much larger fraction if you only look at a very recent baseline (e.g. just compare to 2014-15). A more straightforward number is the 2016 anomaly relative to what it would have been if ENSO were in a neutral phase. I calculated this to be ~0.13 C (0.23 F). 	
“[…]increases their energy costs[…]”	This statement is misleading. If it said “increases energy prices,” it would be correct. But it says “increases energy costs,” which is incorrect because energy efficiency is expected to reduce energy costs on net.	
But-but-but-but Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy told me we only have 12 years!	This confuses the time left to start seriously cutting emissions, with the long tail of impacts that those emissions have. As noted above in this article, there are lags in the climate system that mean CO2 emissions now will continue to warm the planet for a long time, and some long-acting positive feedbacks (like ice melting) take time.	article125.txt
“But the air is already so full of greenhouse gases that most land ice on the planet has started to melt.”	Not sure how I would parse “most of the land ice has started to melt”.  It is true that there is net mass loss from most mountain glaciers, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and the West Antarctic ice sheet, which numerically makes most of the land ice. But, much of the ice remains too cold to melt, the big central region of East Antarctica is not melting, and much of the sea-level rise from the Antarctic is from faster flow into the ocean (after which the ice does melt…) rather than from melting in place.	article34.txt
“Hurricanes Are Moving Slower—And That’s a Huge Problem”	“Huge” may be an exaggeration.	
“Great Barrier Reef may perish by 2030s”	This word ‘may’ is obviously key. The question is: what is the likelihood.	article26.txt
“It’s safe to say [the hot Arctic] is going to have a big impact, but it’s hard to say exactly how big right now.”	This statement is unclear. Arctic warming will clearly have a strong impact on the midlatitudes in the future (certainly by the end of the century). Whether it has had a noticeable effect so far is a lot less clear.	
“The WMO’s assessment of the climate in 2016, published on Tuesday, reports unprecedented heat across the globe, exceptionally low ice at both poles and surging sea-level rise.”	 “Surging” suggests that the faster sea level rise in 2016 has continued, whereas the surge was between Nov 2014 and Feb 2016, as indicated in WMO’s statement and in the data. 	article54.txt
“Converting to these cleaner sources [of energy] may be somewhat costlier in the short term, but they could ultimately pay for themselves by heading off climate damages and reducing health problems associated with dirty air.”	The basic idea of this sentence is correct—that these cleaner sources may be somewhat costlier in the short run, but they also provide benefits that offset the short-run costs. The second part of the sentence is technically correct given that it uses the word “could,” which provides a lot of leeway. A more complete story is that a switch towards these cleaner technologies on the margin for electricity would pay for itself given reasonable estimates of the health costs of fossil fuel generation and the social cost of carbon. It’s also worth noting though that an immediate switch entirely to these technologies would incur transition costs that would likely tip the balance in the cost-benefit analysis, depending on the social cost of carbon used and what sectors we are talking about (are we talking about just electricity? industry? transport?). The vagueness of the statement means that it is less meaningful, but more difficult to critique.	
“In 2009, then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown predicted that the world had only 50 days to save the planet from global warming. But fifty days and years later, and the earth still spins.”	This is extremely misleading. The article this claim refers to reports that Gordon Brown stated that the 2009 Copenhagen Climate negotiators had 50 days to adopt an adequate agreement to prevent catastrophic climate change. The time span of 50 days is inaccurately used by the author here to suggest that Brown thought the world—rather than the negotiations—would end in 50 days.	article36.txt
In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.”	It would be wrong to say, as I often read in the popular press, that all or most of the frozen permafrost carbon will come out as methane, or that Arctic methane will have much impact on climate evolution in the near future. But this article doesn’t exactly say that. Carbon released from permafrost that eventually reaches the atmosphere as CO2 could significantly add to the “long tail” climate impacts from CO2. And this is a much more certain outcome than from methane. The factor of 86 however is totally misleading about the impact of methane vs. CO2. This is an instantaneous impact on radiative forcing (a high-end one at that), and doesn’t reflect the longevity of CO2 (long enough to melt ice sheets) vs. methane (which, emitted now, will mostly be CO2 by the time of peak temperature, say, optimistically, 2050).
