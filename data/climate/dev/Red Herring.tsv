“[Those who signed the Paris Accord] cannot change Earth’s orbit and radiation released from the sun that drive climate”	The problem we are dealing with here is not the radiation released from the sun, but with the amount of energy that remains in the Earth’s climate system. The amount of energy trapped in the climate system increases due to the presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere: rather than shooting the energy back into space, it is used to heat the climate system. Simple physical laws, that make that more greenhouse gases cause a warmer climate. NASA’s Earth Observatory has an extensive explanation. 	
“An “inherent bias” in scientific journals in favour of more calamitous predictions has excluded research showing that marine creatures are not damaged by ocean acidification, which is caused by the sea absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.” 	A publication bias towards positive results is inherent to all fields of research. But I believe that it is far from being as bad as the article suggests. The most recent and comprehensive meta-analysis of the impact of ocean acidification shows that many processes and taxonomic groups exhibit no statistically significant response (Kroeker et al., 2013). This demonstrates that many non-calamitous papers are published. Kroeker K. et al., 2013. Impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms: quantifying sensitivities and interaction with warming. Global Change Biology 19:1884-1896.	
“The coal industry alone supplies almost one-third of America’s electric power — with an increasing amount of clean coal-burning technology becoming available.”	This is misleading. While coal burning has become cleaner due to regulations on the air pollutants it emits, it still emits copious amounts of carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas. Carbon capture and sequestration technologies have proven to be expensive and troubled (For example, see this story in The New York Times).	
“Noaa considers these floods extreme because, based on historical rainfall records, they should be expected to occur only once every 500 years.”	This means that such a flood is expected to have a 1 in 500 chance of happening in any given year. It does not imply that such event occurs regularly every 500 years though. That statistic would hold if the climate were not warming. Since warming is occurring, and the amount of moisture in the air is increasing, the odds of getting these floods are getting larger/more likely.	article32.txt
“So it’s been a surprise to climate scientists that 2017 has been so remarkably warm — because the last El Niño ended a year ago.”	2016 would most likely also have been a record warm year without El Niño. Given the long-term warming trend due to global warming, it was to be expected that 2017 would also be warm. 	article70.txt
We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit. 	We are well aware that there are climatic fluctuations through geological time. Huge numbers of scientists study how the Earth’s climate has fluctuated before, and we know what caused those changes. Current warming is not related to any natural climate cycle, or process, or astronomic phenomenon.	article125.txt
“Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years. If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet, are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade?”	A major storm that has a sea-level higher than it would otherwise have been without climate change will simply be more damaging. It doesn’t matter that current sea-level rise changes are slow. Sandy’s storm surge hit at high tide—a tide that was higher than it would otherwise have been because of human-caused climate change. Some estimates are that damages were many billions of dollars higher as a result.	article39.txt
“Can the “uncertainty monster” in climate research, and particularly climate modeling, be acknowledged?”	The “uncertainty monster” is a reason to act faster. Uncertainties about how strongly the climate will respond makes the risks of climate change larger.	
Carbon dioxide is a trace gas in the atmosphere.	This paragraph is also nonsense because carbon dioxide heating has been directly measured. Satellite data was reported in 20011. And surface data in 2015. The extra heating we’ve caused through carbon dioxide2 is enough to charge more than 700,000 DeLorean’s flux capacitors every second. Or blowing up about 10 Trinity test nukes every second. 1-Harries et al (2001) Increases in greenhouse forcing inferred from the outgoing longwave radiation spectra of the Earth in 1970 and 1997, Nature 2-Feldman et al (2015) Observational determination of surface radiative forcing by CO2 from 2000 to 2010, Nature 	
Globally there’s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods. Some regions experience more, some less and some no trend. Limitations of data and inconsistencies in patterns prevent confident claims about global trends one way or another. There’s no trend in U.S. hurricane landfall frequency or intensity. If anything, the past 50 years has been relatively quiet. There’s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S. Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally. Since 1965, more parts of the U.S. have seen a decrease in flooding than have seen an increase. And from 1940 to today, flood damage as a percentage of GDP has fallen to less than 0.05 per cent per year from about 0.2 per cent.	Tropical cyclones are extreme and rare events thus statistically significant changes are difficult to detect especially given the limitations in historical observations before satellite coverage, but overall coastal flooding is becoming much more of a problem under global warming as sea levels rise. This will only get worse in the future.	article128.txt
“But thus far, researchers do not seem to be arguing that it’s enough to counterbalance the entire human-induced warming trend.”	Of course not. This sentence is highly misleading. As indicated above, the land carbon sink is a well-established phenomenon, not a new theory based on new observations related to Arctic greening and that somehow scientists would now be debating to know whether it will offset global warming entirely. Nobody is even talking about that. The issue is whether the current carbon sink (25% of our emissions) will maintain itself or decrease. 	article28.txt
“Greenland ice sheet … would balloon sea levels by around 7m should it disintegrate”	This is a reasonable number for the total mean sea level rise if all of the Greenland Ice Sheet melted. Total melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet, however, is essentially impossible over the next several hundred years. Nevertheless, the Greenland Ice Sheet has been losing large amounts of ice and the rate of loss has increased over the recent decade or so (references include this paper and this one). The amount of ice Greenland has lost to date has already raised global sea levels and projections indicate the possibility of 0.5 m more sea level rise from Greenland alone over the coming several centuries.
