('“Consider a rigorous study published last year in the journal Lancet that examined temperature-related mortality around the globe.”', 'As the first author of this article, I deem it is worth pointing out that the aim of this study is to establish the association between non-optimal temperature and mortality (in terms of excess deaths) in the recent past, using historical data. The article clearly acknowledges that these results cannot be easily extrapolated to the future, in particular under climate change scenarios, for a series of reasons detailed in the discussion section of the article. For instance, the change in heat and cold-related deaths will depend on changes in future temperature distribution, which is likely to be more complex than a simple upward shift. ')
('“global warming will make the world much greener – by the end of the century, it is likely that global biomass will have increased by forty percent.”', 'This is an inaccurate description of the science. The future of global biomass and the land carbon sink is highly uncertain and spans anywhere from a large increase to a large loss of biomass. The paper cited is wildly out of date (from 2001) and models have progressed immensely since then. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that even these more recent models are over-optimistic (e.g. Allen et al 2015)')
('“a killer analysis conducted by Craig Idso of all the studies which have been done on the effects of reduced pH levels on marine life.”', 'The Idso meta-analysis described by Delingpole was never published. It does not take into account the proper method of proportional scaling analysis. It does not demonstrate how negative effects will impact ecosystem services and food-web processes that can have an effect on economically important fish and shellfish. It does not address the impacts we are already seeing on important fish food, such as pteropods (see Bednarsek et al., 2012, 2014; Feely et al., 2016). There are several highly credible published meta-analysis studies (Kroeker et al. ,2013; Wittman & Pörtner, 2013; and Busch and McElhany, 2016) that have told a much different story than Idso’s unpublished work. Delingpole failed to even mention these other studies, which show very significant impacts on several marine taxa. In summary, Delingpole’s article demonstrates a complete lack of appreciation of scientific literature on this topic and the proper choice of scientific methods for data analysis and synthesis that leads to a more accurate understanding of the present-day and future impacts of ocean acidification.

('“In a new study out last month in the journal Nature, a team of scientists from Cambridge and Sweden point to evidence from thousands of scratches left by ancient icebergs on the ocean floor, indicating that Pine Island’s glaciers shattered in a relatively short amount of time at the end of the last ice age.”', 'As noted earlier, I think there is still some disagreement on whether these are conclusive results.')
('the ongoing rise in sea level that began with the end of the ice age continues with no great increase in magnitude.', 'misleads readers not to mention the research suggesting accelerated global sea level rise1. While the authors may think a 50-100% acceleration of sea level rise is “no great increase”, readers may misunderstand this. 1- Dangendorf et al (2019) Persistent acceleration in global sea-level rise since the 1960s, Nature Climate Change ')
('“Some experts, such as UN climate scientist Dr. Indur Goklany, have defended rising CO2 levels as a good thing for humanity. Goklany has argued that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere ‘is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally.”', 'I don’t believe that Dr. Goklany was ever employed or seconded to the UN. In fact, he would appear to be working for the climate-dismissing think tank, the Heartland Institute.')
('“seawater has a large buffering capacity which prevents dramatic shifts in pH;”', 'This is true; however, the amount of CO2 emitted by humans is also massive, a large portion of which has already been absorbed by the oceans. Since pH is relatively insensitive to changes in CO2, it is often not the right parameter to look at in the whole system. For example, over the range of pH values which the author states are found in natural seawater, the surface pCO2 changes from 180 ppm (pH 8.3) to 1500 ppm (pH 7.5). Thus, a mean change in ocean pH of 0.3 pH units represents almost a tripling of seawater pCO2. ')
('in 1995 one scientist at the IPCC – Jonathan Overpeck – wrote an email to a colleague claiming ‘we have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.’', 'While David Deming has made this claim many times in the past, there is no evidence that Overpeck actually ever said this.')
