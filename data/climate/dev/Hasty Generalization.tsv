“Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea-level rise, leading to net land-area gain. This is not only true for the Marshall Islands. […]several studies have documented noteworthy shoreline progradation [growth] and positional changes of islands since the mid-20th century, resulting in a net increase in island area.”	This statement is oversimplified and cannot be generalised. For example, there is evidence from the Solomon Islands that five islands have disappeared in recent years while six others have experienced severe shoreline recession*. This evidence is based on time series of aerial and satellite imagery from 1947 to 2014 of 33 islands, along with historical insight from local knowledge: “Shoreline recession at two sites has destroyed villages that have existed since at least 1935, leading to community relocations…” Albert S et al (2016) Interactions between sea-level rise and wave exposure on reef island dynamics in the Solomon Islands Environmental Research Letters 	
While members of the media may nod along to such claims [about changes in weather extremes], the evidence paints a different story	This is again misleading. The evidence that is mentioned in this article is only one part of the complete picture. It focuses only on North America and only on the observational period. It neglects observational evidence from other regions in the world and the insights from climate projections.
