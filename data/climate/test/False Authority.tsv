But it is part of a long list of studies from independent teams (as this interactive graphic shows), using a variety of methods that take account of critical challenges, all of which conclude that climate models exhibit too much sensitivity to greenhouse gases.	The text refers to a “long list of studies from independent teams“ using “a variety of methods”, but effectively they are all doing the same thing: relating forcing and ocean heat uptake to the observed warming. Dozens of other studies have demonstrated that the simple energy balance models provide climate sensitivity estimates that are too low1,2. The study by Lewis and Curry claims to account for that, but the effects could be much bigger3. The text fails to discuss that there are literally hundreds of studies about climate sensitivity. We refer to over 400 in our review2. Taken together, they do show a substantial uncertainty range, but they do not support the “lukewarm” position. And there is no evidence that estimates of climate sensitivity have decreased recently. 1-Knutti and Rugenstein (2015) Feedbacks, climate sensitivity and the limits of linear models, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, A 2-Knutti et al (2017) Beyond equilibrium climate sensitivity, Nature Geoscience 3-Gregory and Andrews (2016) Variation in climate sensitivity and feedback parameters during the historical period, Geophysical Research Letters 	article103.txt
“[Pruitt’s statement] was an accurate and judicious answer”	It is objectively not an accurate answer and is misleading at best. [Pruitt’s statement has been reviewed by scientists with Climate Feedback and found to be incorrect.] While it is certainly challenging to determine human influence on the climate, decades of research by tens of thousands of scientists from different institutions all over the world have yielded a nearly unanimous consensus with extreme confidence that humans are the dominant cause of climate change. In fact, scientists have been questioning and researching human influence on the climate for nearly 200 years. Further, we can use techniques similar to the smoking-cancer causality research to prove that humans are mainly responsible and to show that carbon dioxide is the primary control knob for today’s climate change. There is no “tremendous disagreement” or “debate” about this.	article52.txt
“In responding to the IPCC report, our message as scientists is simple:	This might give the impression that the authors of this statement are separated from the IPCC community. It’s more complicated than that: some of the authors here are also IPCC contributors. They may have felt, however, that not enough emphasis was placed in the latest IPCC discussions and report on the role of forest protection and restoration as a mitigation option to climate change. So it’s more a matter of nuances than opposition. 	article112.txt
Atmospheric scientist John Christy developed a global temperature record of the lower atmosphere using highly accurate satellite soundings.	The authors are referring to microwave sounding instruments, which provide a measure of tropospheric temperature changes. These records are useful, but have substantial uncertainty. In the State of the Climate Report1, various estimates of tropical tropospheric warming had a range of 0.12 – 0.22 K / decade across four datasets (that all use the same underlying satellite data). This is nearly a factor of two difference in the long-term rate of warming. This “structural uncertainty” results because researchers use different approaches to remove known biases that affect long-term trends. No method is perfect, which leads to widely varying estimates of atmospheric warming. 1- Christy et al (2019): Tropospheric Temperature [in “State of the Climate in 2018”], Bulletin American Meteorological Society 	article130.txt
“In 2004, two NOAA scientists, Richard Feely and Christopher Sabine, produced a chart showing a strong correlation between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and falling oceanic pH levels. But then, just over a year ago, Mike Wallace, a hydrologist with 30 years’ experience, noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information[…] his results were surprising: there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last -century.”	Michael Wallace contacted Chris Sabine and myself several years ago and asked how to get access to historical pH measurements in the oceans so he could determine long-term trends of global ocean pH for himself. We directed him to both modern (as published in Feely et al., 2008) and historical pH measurements archived at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. We cautioned him that the earlier data sets prior to 1989 had significant issues with data quality as described in the document that went along with the data set obtained from NCEI. Mr. Wallace went on to perform his analysis of the historical data without regard for the oceanographic community’s concerns about the data quality or for the proper methodology to perform this kind of analysis. He chose to publish his results within the context of an interview written by Marita Noon in the Farmington Daily Times. We responded by correcting the record by formally restating our concerns about Mr. Wallace’s incorrect use of the historical data on our website. In short, Wallace’s chart does not show any kind of useful trend in global ocean pH because the data he used, and the way he used them, were not appropriate for this kind of analysis. In the first place, the pH measurements prior to 1989 were not reliable enough to detect small pH changes over that period. In addition, companion meta data on sensor calibration, pH scales, and temperature corrections were not available. Finally, the data were so limited that no meaningful global averages could be determined. The article by Mr. Delingpole in The Spectator failed to address these important issues, as Philip Williamson correctly points out in his response to the article.	
“that is a sign the underlying global warming trend is stronger than ever.”	The rate of warming has been about the same since 1980. The warming is only exceptionally strong if you were deceived by people claiming that global warming had/has stopped. 	article70.txt
on average, the projected heating by the models is three times what has been observed.	As suggested in the last comment this statistic is quite uncertain (1.5 – 3.3). Some climate models simulate less warming than some satellite datasets. The reason that the average of the CMIP5 models exhibits more warming than observations is in part due to natural variability and problems with the forcing (aerosols, solar changes, etc.) in the models.	article130.txt
“Not only do polls suggest the public is unmoved at home and in abroad…”	This claim is incorrect. The source given to support “the public is unmoved at home” is an article titled “Poll: 91% Of Americans Aren’t Worried About Global Warming.” However, this article reports that “only 9.2 percent of Americans rank global warming as their biggest concern.” Not ranking global warming as your biggest concern is not the same thing as not being concerned at all. According to a 2016 Gallup survey, 64% of Americans are “worried a ‘great deal’ or ‘fair amount'” about global warming:	
“Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates”	This was a common perspective before the era of satellite data that showed rapid changes on ice sheets.	article82.txt
“In 2013, scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise by the year 2100. But now some of them are starting to say that six or seven feet may be possible.”	This is a correct statement, but a key word is ‘some of them’. There have been some people, notably Jim Hansen, who, as I understand it, have been proposing high rates of sea-level rise without providing a mechanism for these sea-level rise rates that seemed plausible to most glaciologists. It is my understanding that the mechanisms proposed by DeConto and Pollard (i.e., mechanical instability of ice cliffs) does appear to be plausible and has some support in observations of ice shelf break-up that has already occurred in Antarctica. In other words, if this sentence were written a year ago, “some of them” would have referred to a few scientists who hold what might be considered ‘outlier’ views. Following the work of DeConto, Pollard, and others, my sense is that the risk of very high rates of sea-level rise seems substantially higher, even to what might be considered ‘mainstream’ scientists.	article34.txt
