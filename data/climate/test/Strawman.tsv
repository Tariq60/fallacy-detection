This scientist proved climate change isn’t causing extreme weather 	This is misleading. The main argument of Pielke’s presentation at the University of Minnesota, the Hohenkammer Consensus Statement, and the IPCC reports is that the increasing COST due to extreme weather cannot be linked to climate change.	article128.txt
“Unlike genuine pollutants, carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas. Every human being exhales about two pounds of CO2 a day, along with a similar amount of water vapor. CO2 is nontoxic to people and animals”	Timothy Osborn, Professor, University of East Anglia, and Director of Research, Climatic Research Unit: This is a diversionary tactic: the concern about CO2 is not about its smell, its colour or its direct toxicity; instead it is about its effect on the Earth’s climate. So it is a strawman statement that may be easily demolished but not relevant to the concern about CO2 and climate change.	article40.txt
“The term ocean acidification was also a misnomer, he said, because it suggested that the oceans could become acidic instead of alkaline.” 	This is like saying that it is wrong to say the Arctic is warming because it is still cold. ‘Warming’ and ‘acidifying’ both refer to a direction of change and do not specify the state of the system. This claim about a misnomer is based on a misunderstanding of how words are used.	
New Report Warns “High Likelihood Of Human Civilization Coming To An End” Within 30 Years	The headline overstates the conclusions of the report (which is already overdoing things). The reports says it presents a scenario, and under that scenario and all the assumptions within it, the report claims that there is a “high likelihood of human civilization coming to and end” – but even then, the report itself does not give the end of civilisation within 30 years. The process supposedly leading ultimately to collapse begins around 2050 but takes a long time to take effect. Also the processes themselves are not well-grounded in science, as they over-interpret published work.	
“Climate change might be worse than thought after scientists find major mistake in water temperature readings The sea was much colder than previously thought, the study suggests, indicating that climate change is advancing at an unprecedented rate”	Even if it were correct, there is no direct link between our understanding based on the method discussed in the paper and our understanding of the severity of future and present climate change. The paper does not find a “major mistake” but suggests there may be complications with ONE method used to reconstruct past ocean temperatures.	
“The research challenges the ways that researchers have worked out sea temperatures until now, meaning that they may be increasing quicker than previously suggested.”	I don’t think there’s a link between alteration of deeply buried sediments in this study (i.e., oxygen isotope measurements from millions of years ago) and current rates of temperature increase (directly measured from satellites and weather stations). It may challenge the way we work out sea temperatures (although as I will note later the paper seriously overstates its case), but this doesn’t change the observed rates of change in the post-industrial era. This is inaccurately presented.	article80.txt
what this study proves is that there is nothing we can do to stop the Earth’s naturally occurring climate cycles.	This study does absolutely no such thing. Its topic wasn’t even related to showing climate cycles—the subject of the paper is looking at the effect on CO2 of ice sheets scraping soil and weathered rock off the Earth’s surface over ice ages. CO2 rise and warming that is happening now is entirely something that we have caused (see here for some helpful pointers). We can control our CO2 release, and so we can control our current rate of warming. What the background conditions do over millions of years is not the point, and is only used in this article as a distraction.
