('Could natural factors be the cause of the warming? Nope.”', 'We are sure that natural factors alone could not have caused the observed warming—without the increase of greenhouse gases there would not be so much warming—but they could have contributed. For the period 1951 to 2010 our best estimate is that all of the warming was due to human activities. But natural factors could have warmed or cooled the Earth a bit. In the period around 1900, part of the warming was probably natural due to fewer volcanic eruptions and a stronger Sun. [Also see this related Claim Review. ]')
('There’s no trend in global droughts. Cold snaps in the U.S. are down but, unexpectedly, so are heatwaves.', 'The temperature claims are a bit misleading. We experience more and more record breaking warm temperatures over time due to global warming. These changes are damaging for many reasons beyond drought.')
('“Global sea level rise surged between November 2014 and February 2016, with the El Niño event helping the oceans rise by 15mm.”', 'A large part of this rise is related to the transition from La Niña to El Niño. The background rate of global sea level rise is still between 3-4mm per year.')
('According to the study, scientists also discovered that during this period of Global Warming “there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.”', 'This is where the real logical fallacy of this article becomes clear. Indeed, when CO2 was naturally as high as we have caused it to be now, the world was much warmer than today because of the naturally higher CO2. It therefore follows that the high CO2 levels we have created in the atmosphere will lead to a warmer world, just like the Pliocene.')
('We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit. ', 'This entire article’s “proof” is just saying that “higher CO2 happened before humans, therefore humans can’t cause higher CO2“. Here are logically identical arguments: “England scored goals before Harry Kane, so Harry Kane can’t score goals” Or in American English: “The New England Patriots scored touchdowns before Rob Gronkowski, so Rob Gronkowski can’t score touchdowns” Or more simply: “Fires happened before humans, so humans can’t cause fires”. So if you agree with this article’s logic and that humans aren’t causing CO2 to rise, you also have to believe that Harry Kane and Rob Gronkowski never scored anything and could never score anything, and that no fire has been caused by a human ever. Human-caused global warming, goals by Harry Kane, touchdowns by Rob Gronkowski, and fires set by people are all in the same boat. We have enormous evidence that they exist.')
('Do we really believe that one bellowing fan in a crowd of 85,000 at the MCG can completely change the course of a game?', 'Do we really believe that one player in a stadium with an audience of 85,000 can make a difference? Naturally also small concentration can matter. Many substances are, for example, poisonous at much smaller concentrations. What matters is the amount of CO2. That there are also inert molecules in the atmosphere does not change the radiative influence of CO2. It is pretty amazing that Plimer states in this same article that “Over the past 30 years, planet Earth has greened due to a slight increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.” Suddenly it is no problem that CO2 is a trace gas.')
('The effect of long-term warming is to make it harder to count on snowmelt runoff in wet times', 'This is true even if there is no large-scale change in overall precipitation in the watershed. Warmer temperatures will both increase local evaporation rates and cause an earlier and reduced snowmelt season. Both of these mechanisms reduce the availability of snowmelt runoff through the summer.')
('“The chain of events that links the melting Arctic with weather to the south begins with rising global temperatures causing more sea ice to melt. Unlike on the Antarctic continent, melting ice here exposes dark ocean beneath, which absorbs more sunlight than ice and warms further. This feedback loop is why the Arctic is heating up much faster than the rest of the planet.”', 'This statement correctly identifies how the sea ice-albedo feedback contributes to Arctic temperature amplification, but incorrectly implies that it is the only process responsible for the enhanced warming. While some studies have concluded that the sea ice-albedo feedback is the primary driver of Arctic amplification [1-2]\u200b\u200b, other feedbacks [3-4]\u200b\u200b, internal atmospheric variability, and decadal variations in sea surface temperature and ocean circulation [\u200b5]\u200b\u200b, may have contributed as much, if not more, to the Arctic tropospheric temperature increase. 1.

('“The news comes amid mounting evidence that the recent run of world record high temperatures is about to end.”', 'The modest decline in temperatures in the past few months is a normal reversion after the end of the El Niño event. It has relatively little impact on the longer-term warming trend, which is the most scientifically relevant metric of climate change. ')
