“Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off.”	Yes, human-caused warming boosts the background temperature, so that warming associated with El Niño can now reach levels intolerable by corals.	article42.txt
In its 5th assessment report in 2013, the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010. But it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere.	In its 2013 fifth assessment report, the IPCC stated in its summary for policymakers that it is “extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature” from 1951 to 2010 was caused by human activity. By “extremely likely”, it meant that there was between a 95% and 100% probability that more than half of modern warming was due to humans. This somewhat convoluted statement has been often misinterpreted as implying that the human responsibility for modern warming lies somewhere between 50% and 100%. In fact, as NASA’s Dr. Gavin Schmidt has pointed out, the IPCC’s implied best guess was that humans were responsible for around 110% of observed warming (ranging from 72% to 146%), with natural factors in isolation leading to a slight cooling over the past 50 years. For more details, see my Carbon Brief explainer on why the best-estimate of the human contribution is around 100% of observed warming.	
“While transient weather variability is playing a key role here, the widespread record warmth across the U.S. so far this year is part of a long-term trend toward more warm temperature records versus cold ones.”	I agree that the year-to-year natural variability can contribute significantly to extreme temperatures, especially at local or regional scales. The disproportionate number of record highs versus record lows over several years-to-decades suggests that the seasonal temperature distributions (or likelihoods of experiencing a given extreme during any given season) are shifting toward warmer temperatures consistent with long-term anthropogenic global warming. How continued warming affects the tails of the distributions (beyond just shifting the location) is an interesting and open question.	article50.txt
The buoy temperatures, which are measured by precise electronic thermistors, were adjusted upwards to match the questionable ship data. Given that the buoy network became more extensive during the pause, that’s guaranteed to put some artificial warming in the data.	The direction of this adjustment does not affect the trends. This has been repeatedly checked and is well known. While the article says “that’s guaranteed to put some artificial warming in the data”, it’s actually guaranteed not to do that. Because mathematics.	article130.txt
“‘Continued investment in climate research and observations is vital if our scientific knowledge is to keep pace with the rapid rate of climate change.’”	Correct. We are learning as we go, observing how the climate is changing, but more effort is required to keep up with changes and to understand the physical processes at play.	
“The amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic has steadily declined over the past few decades because of man-made global warming, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.”	A recent study* makes this link very tangible by attributing every loss of 3 ± 0.3 m2 of September sea-ice area to 1 metric ton of man-made CO2 emissions. Notz and Stroeve (2016) Observed Arctic sea-ice loss directly follows anthropogenic CO2 emission, Science 	article47.txt
“Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed.”	This timeline represented here is not an accurate representation of the paper’s findings. Figure 4 (below) in the paper is the most helpful. It shows that 11 feet by 2100 in not expected in the tested worst case. However, the paper also addresses sea level rise past 2100. Under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 (the worst case they discussed), the paper suggests sea level rise from Antarctica alone could be 15.65 +/- 2 m by 2500. These numbers are shown in Figure 5 of the Pollard and DeConto Nature paper. A still deeply disturbing finding. 	article82.txt
“The ‘ancient carbon’ of Alaska’s tundras is being released, starting a vicious warming cycle ‘This is ancient carbon, thousands and millions of years old.’ It’s being released ‘much earlier than we thought.”	Most of the carbon in the permafrost pool is thousands to tens of thousands year old at the oldest, rather than millions.	
“at least four feet of sea-level rise and possibly ten by the end of the century”	This statement is supported by peer-reviewed literature. 20th and 21st century rates of relative sea-level rise varied from -4 mm/yr to 3 mm/yr, and are dwarfed by potential future rates of 21st century rise, which under high forcing and unfavorable ice sheet dynamics could exceed 2 meters (i.e., a century-average rate of 20 mm/yr) in many locations.	
“Sea level rise is global. But due to a variety of factors – including, for this part of the Atlantic coast, a likely weakening of the Gulf Stream, itself potentially a result of the melting of Greenland’s ice caps – south Floridians are feeling the effects more than many others. While there has been a mean rise of a little more than 3mm per year worldwide since the 1990s, in the last decade, the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually.”	This statement touches upon several issues that are indeed discussed in the scientific literature and it is essentially correct. Let’s try and disentangle things. It is correct that Virginia Key as well as other locations on the US Atlantic coast have experienced a surge of rapid sea-level rise during the past ten years or so. However, this is a very short period in terms of sea-level variations. The longer-term rise in this region (when corrected for local land subsidence) is actually in line with the global average sea-level rise, both for the past hundred years (~1.8mm per year) or measured since the early 1990s (~3 mm per year). The recent rapid rise is thus likely a short-term natural variation (a possibility mentioned later in the article) and may well be followed by a period of very little rise. In the longer run I would expect that sea-level near Miami would continue to increase roughly in line with the global mean sea-level rise, as is indeed discussed later in the article where the future projections with their uncertainties are covered well. It is correct that local sea-level rise can differ from global sea-level rise due to “a variety of factors”, including a weakening of the Gulf Stream. For the relevant period of rapid rise, the last ten years or so, such a weakening has been documented, e.g. in the direct measurements in the RAPID section at 26 °N. So the rapid sea-level rise and the weakening of the larger Gulf Stream System coincide, and have indeed been linked.* Like with sea level, over the short time scale of the past decade this is likely to be dominated by natural variability, although there are also indications of a longer-term, probably human-caused, downward trend. Greenland melting has not caused this, but likely contributed to it. To what extent the Gulf Stream weakening explains the recent rapid sea-level rise in Miami, and to what extent other factors—like changes in the predominant winds—are responsible remains an open research question.

“The Northern Hemisphere jet stream […] flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large. But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does […] the jet stream’s flow can become weakened and elongated. That’s when you can get the resultant weather extremes.”	Very nice description for the lay-audience.	
“The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south, but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker. This means the jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes.”	Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center for Atmospheric Research: The statement regarding what the jet stream is (a “boundary between cold north and warmer south”) is essentially correct, and there is indeed evidence that the north-south temperature difference has decreased in some regions.[1] But there remains considerable scientific uncertainty regarding whether the jet stream is actually “meandering more” in a general sense, and whether these large jet stream meanders are actually caused by sea ice loss.[2-3] 1.

“if oceans do become warmer due to ‘climate change’, the effect will be for them to ‘outgas’ CO2, not absorb more of it”	Incorrect: The effect of warming is completely overwhelmed by the effect of increased atmospheric CO2. Hence, the ocean will continue to absorb massive amounts of CO2 in the future, despite ocean warming.	article45.txt
“The melting Greenland ice sheet is already a major contributor to rising sea level and if it was eventually lost entirely, the oceans would rise by six metres around the world, flooding many of the world’s largest cities.”	This number [six meters] is quoted in virtually every article published about Greenland (in media and science literature!). It’s really an irrelevant number, and without any context can be very misleading, as it is here. The total loss of the Greenland ice sheet may not happen under any reasonable future scenario, and in any case would take many thousands of years to occur. A more meaningful number would be the current estimate of what the net loss might be by 2100; this could then be given as a percentage of the total ice volume on Greenland, but for the purposes of an article like this, where the reader is thinking about human consequences, quoting the total ice volume will only confuse the issue. 	article35.txt
“And this winter’s near disaster at the overflowing Lake Oroville was in part caused by warm storms too.”	The skewed rain-snow ratio this season certainly contributed to some of the precipitation-related impacts this winter. While winter 2016-2017 was not exceptionally warm in the Sierra Nevada, especially relative to recent record-warm years, it was still warmer than average. In middle elevation zones of the Sierra Nevada, precipitation fell as rain rather than snow more often that would have historically been the case—leading to a snowpack that significantly lagged overall liquid precipitation (although both were well above average). (See this article in Eos.)	article57.txt
“The review found that many studies had used flawed methods, subjecting marine creatures to sudden increases in carbon dioxide that would never be experienced in real life. In some cases it was levels far beyond what would ever be reached even if we burnt every molecule of carbon on the planet” 	This is an incorrect statement which has already been debunked before, including by two of the authors of the paper this manuscript referee to.

Extreme values are useful for physiologists to elucidate the cellular and molecular pathways confering susceptibility or resistance to elevated CO2. Yang et al. (2016; fig. 8d) showed that most of the data on the biological response to ocean acidification archived in a World Data Centre were collected at pCO2 values below 1000 uatm, in agreement with the business-as-usual CO2 emission scenario.

“the rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip, but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland’s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea.”	Yes, there are two processes going on here: 1) changes still happening in the solid Earth from the last ice age and 2) current changes to the Greenland ice sheet. The former is impacting our ability to measure the latter. 	article35.txt
“2017 is so unexpectedly warm it is freaking out climate scientists”	2017 is not “unexpectedly warm” nor is it “freaking out” climate scientists, because they predicted this!	article70.txt
It has yet to be demonstrated that the climate change today is any different from those of the past.	Trivially wrong. This time climate change is due to human CO2 emissions. That has not happened before. Source	
“Global warming is largely being driven by emissions from human activities, but a strong El Niño – a natural climate cycle – added to the heat in 2016.”	Yes, as stated in the last IPCC report, human emissions of greenhouse gases have been the dominant driver of climate change since the mid-20th century. No other changes (such as the output of the Sun) can adequately explain the observed warming.	article54.txt
“Arctic sea ice is thicker than ever”	This is wrong. Arctic sea-ice thickness in 2017 is actually at its lowest values compared to earlier years for which we have sufficient data coverage, see: 	article60.txt
“Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called ‘sunny-day flooding’ — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years. The sea is now so near the brim in many places that they believe the problem is likely to worsen quickly.”	This is accurate. Global sea levels have risen by about 20 cm due to human induced global warming in the last 100 years. Both US coasts have experienced this. It is true that subsidence on the east coast has exacerbated this and the last 20 years of natural variations on the west coast may have given folks a false sense of security because it has opposed or hidden the global rise experienced almost everywhere else.	
“The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link.”	The winter link is not certain either. As above, there is some evidence for a North Atlantic Oscillation response but still several conflicting studies.	article44.txt
“You can plug leaks in your home insulation to save power, install a smart thermostat, switch to more efficient light bulbs, turn off unused lights, drive fewer miles by consolidating trips or taking public transit, waste less food, and eat less meat.”	According to a recent study*, having fewer children has the largest impact on personal carbon footprint.

“as surface temperatures of the oceans warm up, the immediate response is more water vapor in the atmosphere. We’re in a system inherently capable of producing more floods.”	Exactly. Every degree C of warming equates to around 7% more water vapor in the air. Not only does this lead to heavier rain, it adds to the warming as water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas.	article32.txt
“We almost take forests as a given but we lose forest every year, which means we are diminishing them as a carbon sink.	Deforestation does happen every year, but on the whole, the latest research suggests that we are currently (over the last 30 years) slightly gaining forests globally (+7% compared to early 80’s), as forest gains outside of the Tropics, in particular in the Northern Hemisphere, are a bit greater than tropical deforestation*. We could certainly limit deforestation to gain even more forests, though. In addition, from a carbon perspective and local climate regulation, tropical forests are probably more important than mid-/high-latitude forests.

“An “inherent bias” in scientific journals in favour of more calamitous predictions has excluded research showing that marine creatures are not damaged by ocean acidification, which is caused by the sea absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.” 	In all fields of research, it is much easier to publish a paper saying ‘We were able to develop convincing evidence that X affects Y’ than to publish a paper saying that ‘We were not able to develop convincing evidence that X affects Y’. That is a bias that is inherent in all of modern science and is not specific to ocean acidification research.	
“Over the coming 25 or 30 years, scientists say, the climate is likely to gradually warm	While the exact details and timing of warming are subject to unpredictable decadal (semi-decadal) climate variability (e.g. El Niño Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation), this statement is largely true.	article77.txt
“some countries are already talking about banning the sale of gasoline cars after 2030”	It’s not only talk. Great Britain has already decided in favor of such a ban by 2040.	article77.txt
there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events,	This is not as universally true as suggested in this op-ed. Changes in extreme events are difficult to detect and depend on definition and region, but there is evidence for some changes in extreme weather events. For example, evidence is provided for decreases in cold nights, increases in warm days, and increases in heavy precipitation over North America1. 1- IPCC (2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis (Ch. 2, p. 162) 	article130.txt
“Without human intervention, the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7,000 parts per million (ppm) in prior eras, whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm.”	But those worlds were rather different to those that humans inhabit. They had things like palm trees and crocodiles in the Arctic, and arguably land in the Tropics was completely sterile because of the heat.	article64.txt
“In 2013, scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise by the year 2100. But now some of them are starting to say that six or seven feet may be possible.”	Yes, I couldn’t agree more. I actually wrote a paper regarding a survey of sea-level scientists. The concluding statement was that most experts estimate a larger sea-level rise by AD 2100 than the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report AR5 projects: Horton, Rahmstorf, Engelhart, and Kemp (2014) Expert assessment of sea-level rise by AD 2100 and AD 2300.

The planet’s average ground temperature has risen by around 1.62F (0.9C)	The latest estimates would place this closer to 1 degree C. Mainly as a result of the run of recent warm years.	
“In the U.S. about 9,000 people die from heat each year but 144,000 die from cold.”	These numbers are not deaths reported as clinically due to heat or cold. It seems Lomborg computed them from the Lancet study, using percentages given by the study, times the total number of deaths.	article25.txt
“Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.”	Global geological sea-level data from the Common Era (last 2000 years), global sea-level data from tide gauge records since 1880 and now satellite sea-level data from 1993 all show that the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. These accelerations in sea level is a cause for great concern. As the satellite altimetry record length grows so does the satellite derived time series of (near) global mean sea surface height. Putting recent estimates of GMSL, 2.6-3.2 mm/yr, into historical context is an important and daunting task, and is necessary in order to quantify sea-level accelerations, both regionally and globally. This CNN article highlights the importance of Nerem’s excellent paper.	article93.txt
Climate change? Global warming? What do we call it? […]You can think of global warming as one type of climate change. The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures, such as shifting rainfall patterns.”	It is also worth noting that global warming refers to global average temperature rising, but this does not necessarily mean that all locations across the globe are warming at all times. 	
there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events,	This is not true. We have good evidence that heat waves are occurring more frequently and that rainfall is falling in more intense events1. These are both things were predicted long ago to occur with global warming. 1- State of the Climate in 2018, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society 	article130.txt
More than 100 climate models over the past 30 years did not predict what actually happened because it was assumed carbon dioxide had the pivotal role in driving climate change and that the effects of clouds, back-radiation and the sun were trivial.	Rather than take Plimer’s word for this, a quick google of climate model predictions (and some evaluation of the quality of sources) will lead you to actual comparison of early climate model projections versus observations. Plimer’s statement is simply not true, climate model projections have been surprisingly accurate despite the simplicity of early computer models. As for the relative contribution of various factors to this warming, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are indeed much more important than other factors like clouds and the sun. See excellent visuals of this here.	
Temperatures in the Southwest increased by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) from 1901 to 2010, and some climate models forecast a total rise of six degrees or more by the end of this century.	True, but in the spirit of transparency, some models forecast only 1.5 -3 degrees of warming. 	article100.txt
there is no relationship between temperature and carbon dioxide emissions by ­humans	Actually there is a relationship if you look on the appropriate timescales.	
“People tend to think of an ice-free Arctic in summer in terms of it merely being a symbol of global change.”	This is a good point. Changes in one part of the Earth system due to warming are not in isolation and result in feedbacks in other parts of the Earth system.	article33.txt
