('“In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.”', 'The author’s facts about methane are generally accurate, but he amps up concern about catastrophic release of methane from permafrost beyond what evidence supports. Scientists also investigate whether methane frozen at the seafloor of some continental shelves can be catastrophically be released to the atmosphere. However, existing evidence suggests that natural processes prevent catastrophe. Marine methane (gas hydrates) are heavily processed in the water column, and no contribution to the atmosphere has yet been observed. See an excellent review by Carolyn Ruppel of the US Geological Survey and John Kessler of the University of Rochester*, which was also summarized in the popular press.

('“With more CO2 in the atmosphere, the challenge [feeding 2.5 billion more people] can and will be met.”', 'There is absolutely no scientific study that would support such a conclusion. And even if there was no climate effect of CO2, a simple speculative growth enhancement by CO2 could not produce such an effect.')
('“tornadoes will grow longer and wider”', 'I’m not aware of any scientific evidence for this claim. There has been some work investigating global warming and atmospheric environments conducive to severe thunderstorms (and tornadoes), but to my knowledge there are no peer-reviewed studies that investigate changes in either “length” or “width” of tornadoes. In general, the net effect of climate change upon tornado activity/intensity remains uncertain1, with evidence for increasingly favorable atmospheric environments for tornado formation in some regions2. 1- Tippett et al (2016) More tornadoes in the most extreme U.S. tornado outbreaks, Science 2- Diffenbaugh et al (2013) Robust increases in severe thunderstorm environments in response to greenhouse forcing, PNAS ')
('One of the main areas of contention is the existence of two strange climate episodes known as The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age. The MWP lasted from about 950 to 1250AD, and temperature ', 'There is little evidence in the academic literature that the Medieval Warm Period was warmer than today in terms of global average temperatures. The PAGES 2k Consortium—a group of dozens of paleoclimate researchers from around the world—found1: “There were no globally synchronous multi-decadal warm or cold intervals that define a worldwide Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age, but all reconstructions show generally cold conditions between AD 1580 and 1880, punctuated in some regions by warm decades during the eighteenth century. The transition to these colder conditions occurred earlier in the Arctic, Europe and Asia than in North America or the Southern Hemisphere regions. Recent warming reversed the long-term cooling; during the period AD 1971–2000, the area-weighted average reconstructed temperature was higher than any other time in nearly 1,400 years.” 1- Pages 2k Consortium (2013) Continental-scale temperature variability during the past two millennia, Nature Geoscience')

It would be quite surprising if the 1-1.5 °C warming we have seen up now makes such a differences. Source: Berkeley Earth')
('“The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm”', 'Climate change doesn’t cause events like this, but probably makes them worse by making storms (which are strong to begin with) more intense and enhancing rainfall in that process. I don’t think anyone can say with confidence that climate change has made tropical cyclones worse. There’s too much natural variability (Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, etc.) and the sample size of intense hurricanes is small. It is consistent with what’s predicted for the future, though. However, I’m not exactly sure where the “30 percent” number comes from for the human contribution to rainfall. For every one degree increase in sea surface temperature, the saturation vapor pressure increases by about 7% based on the “Clausius-Clapeyron” equation. There’s also an assumption that hurricanes will likely get stronger because of climate change, so perhaps the stronger winds will also increase evaporation. ')
