We may not be able to stop it, but we’d better get ready to adapt to it.	The magnitude of equilibrium climate sensitivity has nothing to do with whether or not we can stop climate change. Global temperatures will stabilize when the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasses stabilize. So regardless of the climate sensitivity value, we can “stop” climate change by stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations.	article103.txt
“It seems self-evident that rising sea levels will reduce land area. However, there is a process of accretion, where coral broken up by the waves washes up on these low-lying islands as sand, counteracting the reduction in land mass. Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea-level rise, leading to net land-area gain.”	It’s just plain wrong to assume that all atolls are washing away. It’s also wrong to sugar-coat the sobering facts that rising sea levels will ultimately seal the fate of low-lying islands and their limited soils and groundwater. The confusion isn’t surprising. It’s just more complicated than many expect.	article38.txt
“Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions.”	Global human emissions are indeed only a small percentage of what ecosystems cycle, but the reasoning is completely flawed. Regarding the impact on climate, it is the net emissions that matter, not the amount of carbon that is being cycled over and over. Terrestrial ecosystems take up and re-emit about 12 times more CO2 than humans emit, and oceans cycle about 9 times more CO2 than we emit. BUT! This carbon uptake and release is more or less balanced at the annual scale, and net ecosystem emissions are even negative. Without these ecosystems, atmospheric CO2 concentration would have risen even more as a consequence of fossil fuel burning; the CO2 concentration in the air would already be around 550 ppm (instead of the current ~400 ppm). Hence, it is absolutely misleading to compare amounts of CO2 cycling through the ecosystems with human CO2 emissions in this context. If anything, the CO2 cycling through the ecosystems should be taken as a reason to safeguard them: if we lose these carbon sinks, CO2 in the air will increase no matter what we do.	
” ‘and it’s only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models, everything else, is right off the board’ ” 	Volcanoes have a sizable impact on the climate, but a relatively short-lived one. The impact of a large volcano like the Pinatubo eruption in 1991 will cool the climate for a few years, but after five years or so the system would revert to nearly the same state it would have been without the eruption*. It would take a supervolcano or a large period of extended volcanism to seriously disrupt our modeled scenarios, and these sort of events are relatively rare (the odds of them happening in the next 100 years are very small). Some climate models do actually have volcanoes of various sizes stuck in randomly in the future (since we can’t really predict future volcanism apart from assuming it occurs at roughly the same rate as we’ve experienced in the past), but the inclusion of these don’t really change the expected warming or other climate impacts in the next century.

CO2 is not powerful in that sense, the only thing it does in the system is make the planet greener.	This may be true for certain regions in the mid-latitudes, but it presents a limited view of the Earth system. For regions experiencing drying, plant growth will be limited by the availability of water. Reafforestation at high latitudes (due to a combination of warming and less grazing) changes the albedo, which feeds back to warming the local climate. See for instance Wramneby et al (2010)1: “In the Scandinavian Mountains, reduced albedo resulting from the snow‐masking effect of forest expansion enhanced the winter warming trend. In central Europe, the stimulation of photosynthesis and plant growth by “CO2 fertilization” mitigated warming, through a negative evapotranspiration feedback associated with increased vegetation cover and leaf area index. In southern Europe, increased summer dryness restricted plant growth and survival, causing a positive warming feedback through reduced evapotranspiration.” (abstract) 1- Wramneby et al (2010) Hot spots of vegetation‐climate feedbacks under future greenhouse forcing in Europe, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres 	
“the satellites now show that in recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more that [sic] 0.6 degrees”	While true (and not necessarily in agreement with the more robust thermometer records for this period, this has no bearing on the long-term climate trend, which is driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases. It is misleading and a logical fallacy to claim this says anything about climate change, which is the long-term change in temperatures.	
whenever in the past there was an explosion of plant life, the carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present.	The last time carbon dioxide levels were as high as we’re on course for, sea levels were 25-40 metres higher1. The homes of billions of people would be under this sea level. This is projected to take a long time, but even with relatively low emissions we expect tens to hundreds of millions of people’s homes to be flood risks due to rising seas this century. And annual flooding costs of trillions of dollars without heavy investment in flood defences or abandoning cities2. If you think that potentially causing hundreds of millions of refugees and trillions of dollars in damages is fine because some plants did well in the same conditions millions of years ago when humans weren’t around, then you could support this article. 1- Tripati et al (2009) Coupling of CO2 and Ice Sheet Stability Over Major Climate Transitions of the Last 20 Million Years, Science 2- Jevrejeva et al (2018) Flood damage costs under the sea level rise with warming of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, Environmental Research Letters 	
“[…]even if the countries of the world agree to do what they promised on climate change, […]the promised actions will have no measurable effect on future global temperatures.”	The current promises of governments around the world (INDCs) are not enough to stay below a warming of 2 °C, but they do make a difference. In an article in Nature this June, Joeri Rogelj and colleagues: “The INDCs collectively lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to where current policies stand, but still imply a median warming of 2.6–3.1 degrees Celsius by 2100.” 	
“climate economists see a positive externality, not a negative one, from the human influence on climate. (In technical lingo, the so-called social cost of carbon would be negative.)”	At a minimum, the author should be honest and say that “some climate economists” conclude that the net externalities of climate change may be positive, as the article he links to discusses only the economic views of its author and anecdotes from two climate scientists. Further, the article the author links to discusses only the net economic impacts on “the US and most of the developed countries”, while climate change will impact economies around the globe. This is not a meaningful argument anyway, as the exact value of the climate sensitivity does not inherently determine whether climate impacts will be economically net positive or negative.	article36.txt
“Entire states and nations have to decide to clean up their energy systems, using every tool available and moving as quickly as they can.”	“Using every tool available” is highly debatable, as even tools which are usually perceived to help mitigating climate (e.g. reforestation), may not result in mitigation effects, depending on how they are implemented. A study on European forests* has shown that afforestation since 1750 was responsible for an increase of 0.12 watts per square meter in the radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere, rather than a decrease, because of management choices. Naudts et al (2016) Europe’s forest management did not mitigate climate warming, Science 	article77.txt
“The fall, revealed by Nasa satellites, has been caused by the end of El Nino”	The temperature estimates come from passive microwave radiometers. These instruments’ prime task is estimating air humidity for meteorology—weather prediction. Thus most of the these instruments actually flew on NOAA satellites. It should be noted that they were not designed to be used for long-term climate monitoring. 	
But-but-but-but Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy told me we only have 12 years!	The 12-year figure quoted comes from the 2018 UN “Special Report on Global warming of 1.5ºC,” released last October. In this report, the year 2030—12 years from now—is given as the “point of no return”, if we keep releasing CO2 at our current rate. What this means is that after this point, it is almost impossible to imagine how CO2 in the atmosphere could ever be brought back down to levels needed to keep global temperatures less than 1.5 ˚C warmer. This figure comes from the IPCC report scientists—hundreds of scientists from different fields working all around the world. The article has taken this figure out of context, and is comparing it to something very different. What ThinkProgress says is related to the timescales it takes for the maximum effects of the CO2 released now to take hold. This is not in conflict with the IPCC figure of 12 years cited by AOC—this report talks about the year we must stop releasing CO2 by in order for the long term knock on effects of this CO2 release to not be so detrimental to humankind.	article125.txt
“Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.”	Jacoby emphasizes the logarithmic nature of how CO2 affects the energy balance of Earth, and hence surface temperature (i.e., going from 10 ppm of CO2 to 11 ppm would have a much larger impact than going from 300 to 301 ppm). This is correct, but has been known for well over half a century now, and is fully accounted for in even simple estimates of future warming. This is therefore a distraction.	article52.txt
