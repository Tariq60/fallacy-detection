“Whether Antarctic mass loss keeps worsening depends on choices made today”	This is the biggest opportunity to add more depth to the analysis of this new Antarctic ice loss result. An important point here is that the human fingerprint on this Antarctic mass loss is still hard to identify. A 2013 assessment1 showed that expert opinion is “uncertain and undecided” about whether recent ice sheet behavior simply reflects natural variability or is a response to human-caused climate change. This is essentially because our observations of ice sheet behavior are too short, 30 years at best for satellite observations of the ice sheet. This just meets the minimum definition of a “climatology” with respect to the atmosphere, and we know that the ice sheet operates on longer timescales than the atmosphere (it is a big system to move!). Although West Antarctica has been one of the fastest-warming places on the planet over the last 60 years (sparse weather records begin in 1957), as Steig et al showed in 20092 and Bromwich et al confirmed in 20133, how/whether this atmospheric warming has emerged from natural climate variability is less clear. It is also unclear how this warming trend will continue, as climate in West Antarctica is pushed around by Pacific Ocean-atmosphere variability. From ice core records we (myself and MANY others) have drilled and analyzed across this region we do not see recent anomalies exceeding variability over the last 2000 years4. From measurements of ice borehole temperatures in the same region, the ice itself directly records anomalous warmth over the last 50 years5. Antarctic weather is known to be harsh but it is also some of the most variable on the planet. The human fingerprint of atmospheric warming has emerged everywhere else on the planet as early as about 200 years ago, but we are still waiting for it to clearly emerge in Antarctica (see Figure 2 in Abram et al, 20166). As Mooney explains, how much atmospheric warming comes to Antarctica largely depends on our carbon emission choices in the near-term. In addition to all of this, the ice loss in West Antarctica is less driven by ocean warming as it is by increased delivery of relatively-warm deep ocean currents beneath ice shelves. This delivery is driven by the atmosphere; whether winds blow strong enough in the right direction to drive upwelling currents beneath Pacific-facing West Antarctic ice shelves. Decadal-scale variability of the Pacific Ocean-atmosphere system in turn affect the strength and position of these current-driving winds. Summary: it’s very complicated but the Pacific Ocean is the beast to watch for future West Antarctic ice loss, in combination with the dynamics of Pine Island, Thwaites, and a few smaller glaciers (Smith, Kohler) along the Amundsen Sea coast of West Antarctica. 1-Bamber and Aspinall (2013) An expert judgement assessment of future sea level rise from the ice sheets, Nature Climate Change 2-Steig et al (2019) Warming of the Antarctic ice-sheet surface since the 1957 International Geophysical Year, Nature 3-Bromwich et al (2013) Central West Antarctica among the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, Nature Geoscience 4-Steig et al (2013) Recent climate and ice-sheet changes in West Antarctica compared with the past 2,000 years, Nature Geoscience 5-Orsi et al (2012) Little Ice Age cold interval in West Antarctica: Evidence from borehole temperature at the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide, Geophysical Research Letters 6-Abram et al (2016) Early onset of industrial-era warming across the oceans and continents, Nature 	article102.txt
“This chart gives you a good idea of the direction of the adjustments.”	The chart provides solely a view as to the changes in applied adjustments between consecutive versions of one product. It does not reflect the totality of the adjustments being applied. Showing total adjustments would highlight that these deltas were dwarfed by the existing adjustments applied to the 2008 version. Specifically, the very large spurious warming resulting from biases in the raw marine data record over the late 1930s / early 1940s. The net effect of adjustments in all datasets is to reduce the centennial timescale warming in all the surface temperature products. 	article68.txt
International Energy Agency, a global analysis organization, “continue to see a role for coal for the foreseeable future.”	This statement deserves more scrutiny because it appears that the IEA outlook and the UN Report are considering different scenarios. In the IEA outlook, it is true that coal remains a large component of the global energy system through 2040 under existing and expected policies (“NPS scenario”), but their projection under the “Sustainable Development Scenario,” which takes international climate objectives into account, has coal accounting for 12% of global energy by 2040.	
The bottom line is there’s no solid connection between climate change and the major indicators of extreme weather	As stated in my comments above, this conclusion is not valid. It is based on incomplete reasoning. The argumentation in the article confuses the occurrence of events with their cost, neglects observational evidence from other regions than the US, and completely omits insight from climate projections. The fact that it is still difficult/impossible to attribute individual extreme events to climate change in the observational record makes it easy to say that the link between global warming and increasing extreme events does not exist. But projections are very clear, and the fact that we cannot detect the links in all observations YET does not mean that it will not emerge when the warming signal increases. See also e.g. Suarez-Gutierrez et al1 for a discussion of the role of internal natural variability in distinguishing between different warming regimes. 1 – Suarez-Gutierrez et al (2018) Internal variability in European summer temperatures at 1.5 °C and 2 °C of global warming, Environmental Research Letters	
“The ongoing global bleaching event is the longest-lasting one ever observed, and only the third ever seen. It has occurred during the warmest year on record, which occurred in 2015, and the two most unusually mild months on Earth, which took place in January and February, respectively.”	It should be emphasized to the readers that mass coral bleaching first turns up in scientific records in the early 1980s – with no reports prior to that. Over time, mass coral bleaching and mortality has expanded in frequency and severity, with three truly global events being recorded so far – 1998, 2010, and 2016. The apparent shortening of the interval between global events is of great concern and suggests that anything we can do now to avoid further increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will save very substantial amounts in lost income and livelihoods from subsistence as well as industries such as fishing and tourism. This is an issue of food security – the effects of which are already occurring and which are growing more serious by the day.	article26.txt
Computer models of the climate are at the heart of calls to ban the cheap, reliable energy that powers our thriving economy and promotes healthier, longer lives.	Assessments of climate change include many lines of evidence. In addition to computer models, observations of many aspects of the climate (e.g. changes in land and sea ice, sea level rise, temperature, humidity, etc.) and paleoclimate evidence is considered.	article130.txt
This is a critical error. Getting the tropical climate right is essential to understanding climate worldwide.	So apparently the previous paragraph is not just about the upper atmosphere at around 10 km height, but also just about the tropics. That is a tiny remote part of the climate.	article130.txt
“The news comes amid mounting evidence that the recent run of world record high temperatures is about to end.”	We have had 3 record warm years: 2014, 2015, and likely 2016. Also when Bayern München loses a game, they are still be best team in Germany—when 2017 is not again a record year, global warming will continue.	article43.txt
“ NASA concurred with NOAA, also declaring 2016 the warmest year on record in its own data set that tracks the temperatures at the surface of the planet’s land and oceans, and expressing ‘greater than 95 percent certainty’ in that conclusion. (In contrast, NOAA gave a 62 percent confidence in the broken record.) ”	The difference between NOAA and NASA-GISS is because of the way the Arctic—where much of the warming was in 2016, but where we do not have many measurements—is treated. NOAA excludes much of the Arctic, which gives it a cool bias in 2016, which is accounted for by a larger uncertainty. NOAA. The gray areas are where NOAA’s methods do not have enough observations to compute the temperature. Not computing a temperature is similar to assuming these regions warm like the global average, but the Arctic warmed more. GISTEMP of NASA-GISS uses other mathematical methods and does compute temperatures for the Arctic, which results in a more accurate global average.	
“there are alarming stories every day, like last month’s satellite data showing the globe warming, since 1998, more than twice as fast as scientists had thought”	This sentence is true for RSS data, but it’s somewhat misleading due to lack of context. If you look at the two most recent versions of the RSS data and compute linear trends Jan 1998-Dec 2016, you find that the new version has a trend value for this period of about 2.6 times larger than the previous version. But, it is good to remember that 1998 is a favorite starting point for those that seek to minimize the perceived threat of global warming. This preference is because 1998 is a relative maximum in global temperature (due to a large ENSO event), and thus trends that start in Jan 1998 are smaller than trends that start in other, nearby years. This means that when the change in trends between datasets is reported as a multiplicative effect, the change appears quite large. However, if one calculated the trends for Jan 1999-Dec 2016 instead, the trends increases by a factor of about 1.6, not 2.6, only a 60% increase. Of course this is still a pretty large increase. The sentence also ignores the other sources of lower-tropospheric satellite data. The newer version of the UAH (Version 6.0) data shows less warming than the previous version. Also, the radiosonde datasets show more warming over this period that any of the satellite datasets (except maybe UAH V5.6), and have done so for years. 	
I conclude that it must be ice accumulation, through evaporation of ocean water, and subsequent precipitation turning into ice. Evidence suggests that accumulation of ice on the Antarctic continent has been offsetting the steric effect for at least several centuries.	There is only one place on East Antarctica, called Dronning Maud land, where there is some growth of the Antarctica Ice Sheet, and it does not compensate for the loss that we observe with satellite gravimetry on other parts of Antarctica.	article99.txt
“While record low sea ice is nothing new in the Arctic, this is a surprising turn of events for the Antarctic. Even as sea ice in the Arctic has seen a rapid and consistent decline over the past decade, its counterpart in the Southern Hemisphere has seen its extent increasing.”	Exactly. The “upward trend” has been big news, but in the last two years, sea ice extent around the Antarctic has taken a nose-dive.

“Representatives from the Marshall Islands have been vocal about the need for strong global action on climate. President Hilda Heine has told reporters that longtime residents are leaving the Marshall Islands because climate change is threatening the nation’s existence.”	Mr. Lomborg cherry-picks studies relative to the global average. (Indeed, some areas of the Canadian Maritimes and Greenland are expected to see sea-level fall, but overall the rise is significant and a huge danger to the poor). The idea that aiding the poor was an alternate to addressing climate change was wrong 15 years ago when I last debated Mr. Lomborg and is wrong today. False dichotomies are a sad refuge from the facts of both poverty and climate change.	article38.txt
“The particular signature of warming in 2016 was also revealing in another way, Overpeck said, noting that the stratosphere… saw record cold temperatures last year”	The troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere) has also been rapidly warming. A newly updated record from Remote Sensing Systems using data from NASA satellites shows more warming in the troposphere than on the surface since 1979 (when satellite records began):	
“For example, Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart, depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet. But that fact, documented in more than a dozen scientific papers, is not discussed today as part of polar bear ecology.”	Sea ice conditions are well document to be in steep decline in the southern Beaufort Sea. This polar bear population has declined 25-50% and the loss is related to sea ice loss. There are many papers that address this issue extensively. Heavy sea ice conditions are largely a past issue for ringed seals. It is loss of sea ice habitat as a whole that is negatively affecting ringed seals and thus polar bears. Polar bears have a Goldilocks relationship with sea ice: not too much, not too little, it has to be just right. Dr. Crockford is playing the “too much” sea ice issue to its extreme and ignores the too little aspect altogether. These two papers1,2 are core but there are many more addressing sea ice loss in the Beaufort and the effects on polar bears. 1- Bromaghin et al (2015) Polar bear population dynamics in the southern Beaufort Sea during a period of sea ice decline, Ecological Applications 2- Hunter et al (2010) Climate change threatens polar bear populations: a stochastic demographic analysis, Ecology 	article94.txt
European average ​temperatures were more than 2C above normal 	European temperature this year in June were 2°C above the average over the period 1981 to 2010 (which was already warm due to man-made global warming). Climatologists call such averages over 30 year periods climate normals, a tradition that started before we knew about climate change. This technical term is probably best not used when writing for a general audience. The article understates how special the weather was by not mentioning that this average is 1°C above the previous record in 1999. And that it is about 1°C above the long-term warming trend, which is a rare outlier. 	article129.txt
“This means the global temperature trend has now shown no further warming for 19 years”	This is both cherry-picking of the data (starting with 1998), and not correct anyway.	article60.txt
“It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.”	This sentence essentially ignores many thousands of studies that provide evidence to the contrary (i.e., that human CO2 emissions ARE driving global warming) and is therefore factually wrong. IPCC (2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis 	
“Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed.”	The study referenced1 finds that, assuming some different possible scenarios for the speed of ice sheet processes and the IPCC’s highest emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), Antarctica alone can contribute anywhere from 0.5 to 4.5 feet (Figure 5b and d, below) of sea level rise. The DeConto & Pollard study1 does not include the potential for sea level rise from thermal expansion of sea water, melting of mountain glaciers or the Greenland Ice Sheet in it’s projections, but if these are included, the total sea level rise projected for 2100 may be something like 6 feet. If this is the calculation implicit in this statement that “…six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings”, than it is perhaps a bit misleading, since DeConto & Pollard is only focused on the contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. As DeConto & Pollard say in their study: “…the rates of ice loss simulated here should not be viewed as actual predictions, but rather as possible envelopes of behaviour”. Determining the “likely” amount of sea level rise in the future is a prediction that is strongly dependent on the assumptions about how ice sheet behave and on what time scales. Based on just DeConto & Pollard’s studies, and the assumptions inherent in their model, one can conclude that it is likely that sea level will rise by more than 11 feet, just from Antarctic melting, over the next several centuries, if humans do not significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (see Figure 5 and S7 of DeConto & Pollard 2016). What the glaciological community as a whole considers “likely” depends on which processes we think are likely to be important contributors of ice sheet collapse, which is a matter that is actively under debate. Since the DeConto & Pollard study is relatively new, there is still an ongoing discussion about how likely it is that the Marine Ice Cliff Instability will actually occur and at what rate will it causes ice to be lost from individual glaciers. Though the article as a whole covers some parts of this debate, these individual statements about likelihood do not necessarily reflect a community consensus.

“Until now, scientists have calculated the temperature of the ancient seas by looking at foraminifera, the fossils of tiny marine organisms found in the sediment on the ocean floor.”	This is only one way that scientists have calculated the temperature of the ocean, and they will continue to do so.	article80.txt
“ It has now, even after Hurricane Matthew, been over 4,000 days since a major hurricane (Category 3 or stronger) has made landfall in the U.S. ”	One can always cherry-pick a sufficiently narrow statistic, like major landfalling continental US hurricane, that will support one’s prejudice. The fact is that there has been no pause in ALL Atlantic basin or landfalling (including regions outside the US) storms.
