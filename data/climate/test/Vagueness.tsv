“But the observed warming as monitored by satellites (our only truly global monitoring system) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening.”	The statement is fairly accurate but leaves the inference of causes up to the reader. A recent paper by Santer et al. (2016)* investigated this issue in considerable detail. For middle tropospheric temperatures the paper found that, on average, models showed 1.71 times more warming than the mean of the most recent version of the satellite data for the 1979-2015 period. This is for near global mean temperatures. For the lower troposphere, the models show about 2 times more warming than the satellites. Note that the Remote Sensing Systems lower tropospheric dataset has not yet been upgraded to the latest version, which is likely to show more warming. The article does not discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy, but given the tone of the rest of the article, the reader is expected to use the trend differences as evidence that long-term projections by climate models are suspect. These ratios do not provide such evidence. At least part of the discrepancy is known to be caused by errors in the forcings used to drive the CMIP-5 climate models. After the year 2000, the CMIP-5 models were driven by forecast values for important parameters such as volcanic aerosols, solar output, and stratospheric ozone. The forecasts turned out to be slightly inaccurate, causing the models to predict more warming than they would have if the correct forcings had been used. (Of course, these correct forcings were in the future and thus unknowable at the time the model computations were performed). Other possible causes include natural variability in the real world (which might produce a period of reduced warming) and errors in the model physics. Only errors in the model physics would cause long-term global warming to be overestimated, and there is no significant evidence that supports large errors in the model physics. Over a much longer time period, 1880-present, the warming at the surface agrees well with that expected by the CMIP-5 models. The longer time period is important because the effects of random fluctuations due to natural variability tend to average away as the time period considered gets longer. Santer et al.

Protecting and restoring forests would reduce 18% of emissions by 2030	 The original statement says: could provide 18%[v] of cost-effective mitigation through 2030.	
“Coral bleaching has devastated 93% of the Great Barrier Reef”	This headline stating that “bleaching has devastated 93% of the GBR” is misleading as I explained in a recent article in The Conversation: “It is important to recognise that if bleaching was observed on a reef, this does not mean a particular reef has entirely bleached. […] Perhaps the more accurate way to frame the results (and indeed the wording used in the media release) is to say that only 7% of the coral reefs across the Great Barrier Reef have completely avoided bleaching.”	
“Entire states and nations have to decide to clean up their energy systems, using every tool available and moving as quickly as they can.”	This is not universally agreed upon by experts. The key issue is that it is imprecisely written. I would not be surprised if the intent is correct. But taking it as it is written, it is not clear what “every tool available” includes. Technically, this should include truly everything, including simply shutting down all manufacturing that uses fossil fuels at all. Banning the driving of any vehicle except electric vehicles run on renewables. Banning flying. I doubt that was the intent of the sentence. The same issue holds for “moving as quickly as they can.” What are the limits to”as quickly as they can”? Does it including shutting down the economy? Or is the intended sentence “moving as quickly as they cost-effectively can”? Thus, in short, while the idea is correct, this is imprecisely worded and can easily be critiqued. 	article77.txt
“And some plants – like algae which use carbon for photosynthesis – may even benefit.”	The use of “carbon” here is confusing. However the statement is not totally wrong. It is fine in my opinion to say “some plants maybe benefit” because experiments have only been run on some types of plants and algae.	
“The acceleration is making some scientists fear that Antarctica’s ice sheet may have entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration.”	This is true, but referring to West Antarctic ice sheet would be more precise.	article62.txt
“But the new research shows that the amount of oxygen in those shells doesn’t actually remain constant over time.”	This is a misunderstanding of the way that oxygen isotopes work.	
“The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever. Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.”	This depends on the definition of “pollutant”. To the extent that CO2-induced global warming endangers human welfare and health, CO2 fits the Clean Air Act’s broad definition of “air pollutants”—that’s the reasoning behind the Supreme Court’s decision to let the EPA regulate CO2 emissions. Not that this is relevant to the definition of CO2 as a pollutant (which relies on it causing climate change), but the alleged total non-toxicity is not entirely true: there is some research* showing impairments in cognitive function test scores in people exposed to CO2 concentrations in the 950-1,000 ppm range, and even significantly worse performance when CO2 rose to 1500 and 2,500 ppm. Current atmospheric CO2 is around 400 ppm—possibly going up at least a few more hundred ppm this century without emission cuts—but concentrations greater than ~1000 ppm are often found in poorly ventilated rooms and buildings.

“Not everyone is convinced that the evidence is in that climate change is responsible for extreme swings between drought and deluge.”	There is a considerable and growing body of scientific evidence (see above references) demonstrating that California will likely experience increasingly large swings between extreme wet and extreme dry conditions. The evidence that climate change has already caused such an increase is somewhat less strong—mainly because there are relatively few extreme events in the historical record from which to draw such conclusions. Therefore, this statement is imprecise, and may be misleading if it is intended to convey that scientists substantially disagree regarding the likely future increase in California precipitation extremes. Whether such an increase is yet detectable in the historical record is indeed uncertain; there is much greater certainty regarding the likely direction of future change.	article57.txt
“a constant swarm of out-of-control typhoons and tornadoes and floods and droughts”	Not to nitpick—we don’t really know what a +6 °C world would look like in detail—but the connection between tornadoes and warming is unclear, at least in the observable record. Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center for Atmospheric Research: While there is still some uncertainty regarding the response of tropical cyclones (i.e. typhoons and hurricanes) to global warming, there is now evidence that frequency in many ocean basins may actually decrease, but maximum intensity will likely increase. There is indeed evidence that the frequency and intensity of floods/droughts is increasing over much of the globe*, and will continue to do so as the climate warms. This is not necessarily true universally–there will still be quite a bit of spatial and temporal diversity in the response of precipitation extremes to global warming, even in a six-degree-warmer world. But in general, it’s true that there will be dramatically more flood and drought events on a global basis with multiple degrees of warming.

the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink.”	This is a misleading term. Ice caps are technically large land-based glaciers, whereas I think ‘Arctic icecaps’ here mean Arctic sea ice.  	article33.txt
“and we will need to have invented technologies to extract, annually, twice as much carbon from the atmosphere as the entire planet’s plants now do”	Its unclear in this statement, about the relative amount of negative emissions needed versus the amount of carbon extracted by plants, whether the author means the total amount of photosynthesis by plants (which would be a false statement) or the total difference between photosynthesis, respiration, and disturbance (which would be a true statement). Plants photosynthesize about 120 petagrams of carbon per year, whereas the net land sink is more like 2-3 petagrams of carbon per year. It is the latter number that is comparable in magnitude to the negative emissions technologies required. 	
“Recent computer forecasts suggest that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at a high level, parts of Antarctica could break up rapidly, causing the ocean to rise six feet or more by the end of this century. That is double the maximum increase that an international climate panel projected only four years ago. But those computer forecasts were described as crude even by the researchers who created them. ‘We could be decades too fast, or decades too slow,’said one of them, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. ‘There are still some really big question marks about the trajectory of future climate around Antarctica.’”	 The “recent computer forecasts” referenced here likely refer to the numerical model developed by Rob DeConto1. Different from other ice-sheet models it includes the so-called “Marine Ice Cliff Instability”, which at present is not widely accepted in the ice-sheet modeling community. Including this instability will cause increased rates for resultant sea-level rise projections. On the other hand, DeConto’s model includes simplifications related to how ice sheet slides over the sediment at the base. This ice-sliding parameterization will generally increase ice-sheet stability and cause smaller projections of sea-level rise, as demonstrated in the Nature paper by C. Ritz et al. in 20152. There is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the physical and hydrological processes involved in ice-sheet modeling. Ideally, we prepare for the upper bounds regarding projected rates in sea-level rise, since the scientific community is still far from providing high-confidence estimates. DeConto and Pollard (2016) Contribution of Antarctica to past and future sea-level rise, Nature Ritz et al (2015) Potential sea-level rise from Antarctic ice-sheet instability constrained by observations, Nature Margot Saher, Lecturer, Bangor University, Wales, UK: This is based on a combination of observations and modelling1. Observations show us several glaciers are in decline2 and ice shelves, which serve as a buttress for the glaciers, are thinning due to warmer sea water. This process is seen to be accelerating3. Where ice shelves (like Larsen B) have already vanished, glaciers in the hinterland have indeed sped up4. Numerical models predict that the changes underway now are likely to lead to a full-scale collapse of the west Antarctic Ice Sheet. 1- Joughin et al (2014) Marine Ice Sheet Collapse Potentially Under Way for the Thwaites Glacier Basin, West Antarctica, Science 2- Rignot et al (2011) Acceleration of the contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to sea level rise, Geophysical Research Letters 3- Paolo et al (2015) Volume loss from Antarctic ice shelves is accelerating, Science 4- Scambos et al (2004) Glacier acceleration and thinning after ice shelf collapse in the Larsen B embayment, Antarctica, Geophysical Research Letters
