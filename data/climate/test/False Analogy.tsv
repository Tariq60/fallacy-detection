The surprising thing is that the Energy Balance estimates are very low compared to model-based estimates.	While on average Energy Balance-based approaches (or “instrumental” approaches) tend to give a lower sensitivity than model or paleoclimate results, not all do. See the figure below from Carbon Brief’s recent climate sensitivity explainer, which looks at 143 studies on equilibrium climate sensitivity between 2000 and present: McKitrick also completely ignores all the climate sensitivity evidence from studies of the Earth’s past climate changes (Paleoclimate), which broadly agrees with the equilibrium climate sensitivity range from climate models.	article103.txt
“Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.”	This is flawed reasoning as it is not a sensible analogy for how the greenhouse effect works. The science is more complex: Namely, radiation from the surface at a warmer temperature is absorbed in the layers above which are at a colder temperature; the colder layers emit less radiation so that there is a net loss of radiative energy escaping to space from the atmosphere-surface system as a whole, but coming about due to the “exchange” as formulated. This is true in absorption bands that are transparent and not opaque—i.e., in bands that are not saturated. In bands that are opaque, the radiation emanating from the layer to space represents a “cooling-to-space” and this too represents a “trapping”. In this regard, the lapse-rate and decrease of temperature with height (in the troposphere) are important. The more CO2 that is added to the atmosphere, the more heat that is “trapped” in the climate system, although it is not 1:1 and is instead a logarithmic relationship. However, regardless of the rate, we still have more warming with more CO2—that is unequivocally true.	article52.txt
“the basic rule for staple cereal crops grown at optimal temperature is that for every degree of warming, yields decline by 10 percent. Some estimates run as high as 15 or even 17 percent. Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them.”	These numbers stem from the results of controlled field sites (in, for example, the Philippines, India and Mexico) and refer to the impact of local temperature changes on yield, all else being equal. (Also, note that the major grain producing regions are in the midlatitudes, where the projected temperature increases are substantially greater than the projected global average temperature increase.) The projected changes in precipitation are sufficiently uncertain that it is not possible to quantitatively account for the impact of their changes, although the IPCC 2013 WG1 Report concludes: “In many mid-latitude and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely decrease, while in many mid-latitude wet regions, mean precipitation will likely increase under the RCP8.5 scenario.” (In IPCC lingo, “likely” is greater than 2/3 chance.) Finally, there is also a fertilization effect associated with increasing CO2, although studies have shown that the deleterious impact of increasing temperature far outweigh the impact of increased CO2.	
“Already, scientists know enough to be concerned. About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades. The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked.”	Sea level and temperatures were higher in the previous interglacial, but the Earth climate system generally had a longer time frame to adjust to these conditions.	
“This means that the world is now 1C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times”	The temperature is 1°C warmer than in the beginning of the instrumental temperature record (1880). The 19th century was likely a little colder than the pre-industrial period. This difference is not large and currently being studied, but likely we did not cross the 1°C warming relative to pre-industrial yet.
