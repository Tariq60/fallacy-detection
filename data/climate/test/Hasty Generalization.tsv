“Temperatures in the Arctic have soared recently, and scientists are struggling to explain exactly why.”	The only quibble I have with this article is this statement. I’d say that we have a fairly good understanding of the causes of this warm episode. As mentioned in the article, a very diminished ice cover this summer allowed additional solar energy to be absorbed by the Arctic Ocean, which is then released back to the atmosphere in fall that in turn retards refreezing. Additional moisture is also evaporated from the open ocean, which not only traps additional heat as a greenhouse gas, but also tends to form more clouds that also trap heat. An unusually wavy jet-stream pattern has also transported extra heat and moisture from lower-latitude regions into the Arctic, adding to the warmth. We know many self-reinforcing mechanisms operate in the Arctic, so when some heat shows up there (think greenhouse gases, moisture, etc.), its effects are amplified. This has been understood for a long time, but perhaps the pace of this warming is somewhat unexpected.
“Previous satellite estimates of modern ice losses tried to take this into account, but precise new GPS data showed much of Greenland is rising far more rapidly than thought, up to 12mm a year. This means 19 cubic kilometres more ice is falling into the sea each year, an increase of about 8% on earlier figures.”	It’s a nice study, but the 20GT/yr represents less than 10% of the observed signal and is well within the uncertainty of those measurements (263+/-30 Gt/year – 2005-2010 loss from Shepherd et al, 2012). Moreover, it’s not clear how well sparsely sampled points constrain their estimates, so there is some uncertainty on the 20Gt/yr (it could be more or less). So while we are always striving to improve measurements of ice sheet mass loss, and this is a step in the right direction, it doesn’t produce any fundamental change in the current estimates of rates of loss from the Greenland ice sheet.
