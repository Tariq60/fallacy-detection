('“cold kills many more people than heat.”', 'Mr. Lomborg is confusing seasonal mortality with temperature-related mortality. It is true that mortality is higher during winter than summer. However, it does not follow that winter mortality is temperature-dependent (which summer mortality is). Dave Mills and I reviewed the evidence and concluded that only a small proportion of winter mortality is likely associated with temperature. A growing numbers of publications are exploring associations between weather and winter mortality, with differences in methods and results. The country with the strongest association between winter mortality and temperature is England, which appears in other publications to be at least partly due to cold housing. Winter mortality is lower in northern European countries.')

('“First, marine species that calcify have survived through millions of years when CO2 was at much higher levels; second, they are more than capable of adapting — even in the short term — to environmental change”', 'Many marine organisms respond to changes in calcium carbonate mineral saturation states. These depend not only on pH, but also on factors including amounts of carbon and calcium in the ocean. One of the most important factors is ocean alkalinity, which varies on time scale of many thousands of years. In the geologic past, when atmospheric CO2 was high, ocean alkalinity was also high, and so carbonate mineral saturation states could remain high. Unfortunately, on the timescale of centuries or decades, changes come too fast for the ocean’s natural processes to buffer ocean carbonate mineral saturation states. Directly comparing effects of high CO2 levels that developed in the geologic past over many millions of years with high CO2 levels developing today over decades and centuries shows a fundamental lack of understanding of well-established global geochemical cycles.

In drawing the analogy with the PETM, one may also wonder how long the current rates can be sustained – if anything, compared to the 4,000 years of the PETM – given that such emissions are most likely unsustainable over the long-term, either because of fossil fuel availability constraints, or because of the adverse feedback of climate change on human societies.

('“Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called ‘sunny-day flooding’ — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years.”', 'This is a tricky one. Nuisance flooding on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts is the result of relative sea-level rise. Relative sea-level rise has a variety of components that give the rise a spatial signature. For example along the mid US Atlantic coast one-third of the rise is due to glacial isostatic adjustment with the remainder dominated by climatically driven sea-level rise. But in the Mississippi Delta the dominant driving force is subsidence. However, in the coming century these components will decrease in importance relative to climatically driven sea-level rise. ')

When mass is lost on Antarctica, sea level will fall within a 2,200 km radius due to the loss of gravitational pull. Between 2,200 and 7,600 km, sea level will rise but less than the global average. Beyond 7,600 km, sea level rise will be larger than the global mean, up to 25% extra. For Antarctica, this means that the largest consequences will be in the Northern Hemisphere, with the reverse being true for mass loss in Greenland.

However, it’s generally considered to be a fraction of those. We know better future effects because we have CO2 fertilization experiments in the field comparing present to future CO2 levels. Those experiments suggest that corn may have about a 1% gain [because of increased CO2] and soybeans 3-4 times that. However, these gains will almost certainly be offset by yield declines associated with the temperature increases caused by elevated CO2, which are well known. Historically, it’s worth noting that we had elevated CO2 long before we had the green revolution, and crop yields didn’t increase much until the green revolution. You can see this in graphs of average US corn yields from 1900. Source: University of Nebraska-Lincoln')
('“‘Greenhouse gases emitted through human activities and the resulting increase in global mean temperatures are the most likely underlying cause of the sea ice decline,’ the snow and ice data center said.”', 'Observed trends in Arctic sea ice result from the superposition of forced, man-made variations and internally generated variations. While it is clear from the literature (see IPCC WG1 AR5 Chapter 10 for a review) that observed trends cannot be explained by internal variability alone, it should be remembered that internal variability can also modulate the forced trends, in a way that is complex to properly describe. In conclusion, greenhouse gases are well responsible for the observed decline, but their effect on sea ice trends may have even been amplified by internal variability. ')

Say a warming of 1°C led to a release of carbon from soils that induces an additional warming of 0.1°C (that’s quite a large positive feedback: 10% of the initial perturbation). This additional 0.1°C would lead to an additional release of carbon, inducing an additional warming of 0.01°C, which will lead to more carbon released and an additional 0.001°C warming, etc… Ultimately, warming will be 1.111…°C—larger than the initial warming of 1°C but quite far from a runaway scenario.')

('“To make matters worse, the water temperatures in the Arctic Ocean are several degrees above average, which is an expected result of having less sea ice.”', 'Generally, the absorbed solar radiation leads to enhanced ocean temperatures in the mixed layer, so with summers of less ice the ocean mixed layer temperatures are usually warmer than average. Though even that is more driven by the timing of when the sea ice retreats. If it retreats early in the melt season when the sun is still high in the sky then you get more ocean warming, but if like in 2012 the ice retreats rapidly in August, it doesn’t have the same impact on ocean temperatures because the sun is already starting to set. But while this may be part of the explanation for warmer ocean temperatures at the moment, in the Barents Sea it is actually a result of warm Atlantic waters entering the Arctic. I have spoken with oceanographers about this and the sea surface temperature anomalies are a result of stronger inflow to the Barents Sea and along the west coast of Svalbard. The strong northwards flow of Atlantic water is also consistent with the more southerly winds this November that have helped to bring in warm air temperatures.')
