The IPCC reports also don’t fully account for the albedo effect (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence more warming); more cloud cover (which traps heat); or the dieback of forests and other flora (which extract carbon from the atmosphere). Each of these promises to accelerate warming	I am not sure what the author means here. The climate models whose projections the IPCC reports are based on definitely account for the changes in albedo from reduced sea-ice and snow cover as the world warms (although not necessarily changes in glaciers and ice caps extents—e.g. Greenland—which is maybe what the author means here), as well as the effect of changes in clouds (actually, the largest source of uncertainty in climate models projections); most models also now account for changes in vegetation and include an interactive carbon cycle (for instance, how a reduction in forest diminishes the land carbon sink).	
Scientists say halting deforestation ‘just as urgent’ as reducing emissions	The original statement says: halting fossil fuel use, which is different than reducing emissions since e.g. deforestation also leads to emissions.	
“Sea level rise of 65 centimeters, or roughly 2 feet would cause significant problems for coastal cities around the world.”	It should be mentioned that this is a global average. The increase will not be uniform—exacerbating the consequences described below	
“the adjusted data”	It is surprising that, despite adjusted data being the crux of the arguments made here and in the study referred to, the author never explains why one may need to adjust measurements made on the ground or by satellites. There has been significant media coverage recently of some of the adjustments relating to temperature measurements made by satellites. Simply from a practical standpoint, it is beneficial to consider what is involved in sustaining the orbit of a satellite. Once put into orbit, a satellite will slowly “decay” away from its intended orbit as it is pulled nearer to Earth by gravity and other effects. Unless it has its own propulsion to correct for this, it will eventually be pulled out of orbit. This decay affects the exact time of day during which the satellite repeats measurements over one location. For example, from 1995 to 2005, the time of day that a NOAA satellite (NOAA-14) passed over the equator changed by more than 6 hours. The temperature in Quito at 12pm local time versus 6pm local time is quite different, so the satellite measurement must be corrected for this and other effects. More details from this excellent article by Zeke Hausfather.	article68.txt
“Global Ocean Circulation Appears To Be Collapsing Due To A Warming Planet”	I’m a little hesitant about the title. The slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is not the same thing as the “collapse of global ocean circulation”. It might be more accurate to say that the AMOC is at risk of collapsing in a warming world. Also, it’s worth noting that although we understand that there is a connection between AMOC and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the mechanisms involved in this connection are still under investigation.	article72.txt
“the mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius that the planet has experienced since the middle of the 19th century”	This figure [0.8°C] is generally accurate. Global average air temperature has increased by just under 1.0ºC, according to NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and confirmed by numerous other organizations: Source: NASA GISS However, it is quite disingenuous to suggest that warming the entire atmosphere by this amount is “mild.” Yes, it is a relatively mild adjustment on your home thermostat, increasing the temperature by less than one degree. For Americans, if your home is heated to 65ºF and you increase the temperature by 1ºF, that is equivalent to about a 0.6ºC increase. Heating the amount of air in your home is quite a different matter than heating the entire atmosphere. Just to start, the atmosphere has an approximate mass of 5 x 10^18 kg—that’s 5 quintillion kg or 11 quintillion pounds. In just over 100 years or so, we’ve increased the global air temperature thermostat by a staggering 0.8ºC—and we’re still emitting the greenhouse gases responsible for the warming.	article65.txt
“The Arctic’s carbon bomb might be even more potent than we thought […] methane, a shorter-lived but far harder-hitting gas that could cause faster bursts of warming”	This wording suggests that permafrost melt in the Arctic is an abrupt event. Even the new research referred to here doesn’t put earlier work* fundamentally into question that argued for “a gradual and prolonged release of greenhouse gas emissions in a warming climate”. Shuur et al (2015) Climate change and the permafrost carbon feedback, Nature 	
A “Hothouse Earth” scenario plays out that sees Earth’s temperatures doomed to rise by a further 1°C (1.8°F) even if we stopped emissions immediately.	This word choice perhaps reveals a bias on the part of the author of the article. A temperature can’t be doomed. And while I certainly do not encourage false optimism, assuming that humanity is doomed is lazy and counterproductive.	
“Recent computer forecasts suggest that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at a high level, parts of Antarctica could break up rapidly, causing the ocean to rise six feet or more by the end of this century. That is double the maximum increase that an international climate panel projected only four years ago. But those computer forecasts were described as crude even by the researchers who created them. ‘We could be decades too fast, or decades too slow,’said one of them, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. ‘There are still some really big question marks about the trajectory of future climate around Antarctica.’”	This reflects recent research—an important point is that this is about possible future consequences of high emissions, which are hence avoidable if emissions are lower. This is in contrast to the opening sentence and headline, which talk of “unstoppable disintegration” already in progress.	
“In 2013, scientists reached a consensus that three feet was the highest plausible rise by the year 2100. But now some of them are starting to say that six or seven feet may be possible.”	In the 2013 IPCC report, there is a reference period (1986-2005),  there is an assumption of a reference pathway of future emissions, and there is a confidence assigned to the estimate.  That being said, I think the statement is pretty good.  The second sentence is I believe accurate; the work by DeConto and Pollard, building on Pollard et al. (note that I’m involved in this study), for example, points to the possibility of rapid warming triggering rapid sea-level rise.	article34.txt
“And some plants – like algae which use carbon for photosynthesis – may even benefit.”	This sentence is not really wrong but imprecise. First, plants use carbon dioxide (or in the case of aquatic photosynthetic organisms CO2 and often bicarbonate). The term “carbon” is too general. Second, the sentence implies that only some plants use carbon dioxide. I am sure the author is aware that “all” plants use CO2 for photosynthesis.	
“‘Acid’ was chosen, Moore believes, because it has ‘strong negative connotations for most people’.”	The terms acidification was not chosen for its negative connotation but rather because it defines the direction of change. Here is a simple example: when you describe the cooling of your coffee what term do you use? Cooling or un-warming? If the temperature is going down we say it is cooling. If the temperature is going up we say it is warming. The same applies to acidity. When the pH of something goes down we say that it is acidifying. That simple.	article45.txt
“Climate change? Global warming? What do we call it? […]You can think of global warming as one type of climate change. The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures, such as shifting rainfall patterns.”	This is a good way to describe the difference in language. It would also be reasonable to say that global warming (the increase in Earth’s average temperature) causes climate change (shifts in the location/frequency/intensity of weather patterns). In practice, the two terms are often used somewhat imprecisely and interchangeably (even in the scientific literature).	
“Underneath the permafrost there are sediments full of methane hydrates. When the permafrost goes, you release the pressure on top of these hydrates and the methane comes out of solution”	It’s unclear what is meant by ‘permafrost goes’. Nothing particularly ‘goes’ anywhere, it just melts (and has been naturally melting due to post-Last Glacial Maximum sea level rise and the resulting thermal flux due to shelf inundation). Consequentially, I would not expect the pressure seen by the underlying hydrates to decrease if the overlying permafrost degrades. In fact in the real world it will probably increase due to anthropogenic sea level rise. So it will necessarily be an anthropogenic temperature pulse, not a pressure pulse that will destabilize methane hydrates under relic permafrost. Finally, methane molecules in hydrates is not ‘in solution’ but rather in the hydrate crystalline lattice. 	article33.txt
“Ice cap is disappearing far more rapidly than previously estimated, and is part of a long-term trend, new research shows”	Again, “ice sheet” is more accurate than “ice cap”. In general, the term “ice cap” is not used in scientific literature. As a result, I think its use is confusing in the media, too, as people have a hard time understanding if it refers to ice sheets (thick ice on land) or sea ice (which are very different!).	article35.txt
“parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable”	I am not sure how one defines habitability. Paucity of resources (e.g., water, vegetation) does not necessarily make a region uninhabitable. So I think that strictly speaking, the author is referring here to studies showing that the combination of heat+humidity may exceed a threshold for human survival some part of the year in already-very-hot-an-humid parts of Southwest Asia (around the Gulf of Persia) by the end of the century1. To my knowledge this kind of result hasn’t been shown for other regions, so in that context, the sentence “parts of”, while technically correct, may imply more than has been established. Note, however, that even without exceeding survival limits, humid heat increases would have impacts on outdoor activities2. Pal and Eltahir (2016) Future temperature in southwest Asia projected to exceed a threshold for human adaptability, Nature Climate Change Dunne et al (2013) Reductions in labour capacity from heat stress under climate warming, Nature Climate Change

“Despite recent attempts to paint the United States as a major global polluter, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. is among the cleanest nations on the planet.”	This Breitbart article is playing with words, arguing that CO2 is not a “pollutant”. When it comes to CO2, the US is the second largest emitter after China. CO2 is a greenhouse gas, primarily responsible for climate change, inducing negative impacts on human and ecosystems. Replace the word “polluter” with “emitter” and the whole article falls apart—there is no story here.	article64.txt
It breaks my heart to think we’d lose half our tropical forests for plantations just to save ourselves	So this seems to suggest that half of tropical forests are supposed to be cleared to make room for large-scale BECCS in scenarios where global warming is limited to 1.5C (or even 2C). This seems like it could have been described more clearly than in passing, in that quote.	article112.txt
“Climate change might be worse than thought after scientists find major mistake in water temperature readings The sea was much colder than previously thought, the study suggests, indicating that climate change is advancing at an unprecedented rate”	This title and subtitle are totally misleading. The question of whether or not some (and I stress some because this only affects one proxy, not the others that suggest warm temperatures) temperature estimates were wrong has no bearing at all on the rate of current climate change.	
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (Beccs), is untested	The statement says: untested at large scale.	article112.txt
“More acidic oceans ‘will affect all sea life’”	“More acidic” is not entirely correct as the ocean is strictly speaking still alkaline (pH>7) and will remain so in the future. It is nevertheless true that the pH will most likely decrease (and has already done so in the past). A small change in the pH leads to large shifts in seawater carbonate chemistry (as the author correctly mentions later in the main text). The pH change will affect many species. I am not sure if the statement “all sea life” is justified at this stage. Indirect effects will likely play a major role here (as mentioned later in the text) but this still lacks evidence. This is more like “work in progress” I would say.	
“But as long as there are still unburned fossil fuels in the ground, it is not too late to act.”	This statement is imprecise, and depends on value judgments of what “too late” means. Even emitting only a fraction of the available unburned fossil fuels would eliminate important ecosystems like coral reef habitats. For these ecosystems it will thus be too late. Because part of the CO2 that is emitted will remain in the atmosphere for many centuries, climate change constitutes a cumulative problem. Halting CO2 emissions before the last fossil fuel has been burned thus indeed commits the world to less impacts than the theoretically maximum. However, whether this is not “too late” depends on whether no irreversible or societally unacceptable impacts were reached before that point. The latter requires societal value judgments informed by scientific assessments, but is ultimately not a scientific question.	article77.txt
“it now seems like three feet is possible only under the rosiest of scenarios”	Including the contribution from thermal expansion of seawater, mountain glaciers, and Greenland, three feet is probably a good estimate for the lower bound on the total sea level rise that can be expected from current and past climate change (many studies ask this question, but Pfeffer, 2008* is an oft-cited example). The key phrase here is total sea level rise, which may unfold in the next century or over the next several millennia as ice sheets continue to respond to past climate change for many hundreds to thousands of years. If this phrase refers to three feet of sea level rise from Antarctica by 2100, then it does not accurately represent the findings of DeConto & Pollard (see RCP 2.6 in Figure 5 of that study, above). Pfeffer et al (2008) Kinematic Constraints on Glacier Contributions to 21st-Century Sea-Level Rise, Science	article82.txt
to avoid runaway climate change	“Runaway climate change” is too strong here. The original statement says: These “natural climate solutions” could provide 18%[v] of cost-effective mitigation through 2030, which is in reference to avoiding 2°C of climate change. This information relates to reason 2 in the original statement.	article112.txt
“Dr Browman, a marine scientist for 35 years, said he was not saying that ocean acidification posed no threat, but that he believed that “a higher level of academic scepticism” should be applied to the topic. 	By making such broad statements, Dr Browman is undermining the hard work of many people who have spent a huge amount of effort to document the effects of ocean acidification on many marine species. If Dr Browman wants to attack particular studies, he should cite particular statements from particular papers that he thinks are false. It is inappropriate to make vague accusations denigrating an entire field of inquiry. 	
“Global warming and climate change, even if it is 100% caused by humans, is so slow that it cannot be observed by anyone in their lifetime. Hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and other natural disasters have yet to show any obvious long-term change.”	This statement is far too broad to be supportable, and is misleading in a few ways. Among the many aspects and impacts of climate change, some are evolving slowly and others more quickly (quickly enough to be detected within a 70-year human lifetime). There is a very important difference between saying “there has been no change”, versus “the data records are not long enough to formally detect a change”. For example, our present records of hurricanes do in fact show very large and statistically significant increasing trends in a number of measures since the 1800s. But we also know that the older data are of a lower quality than modern data, so we are uncertain of what part of the trends are due to the data issues and what part may be due to human influences. The scientific community has established a very strict set of rules for formally establishing whether or not a trend has been detected, and we constrain our statements within this rigid framework. The author’s statement here violates those rules and is unsupportable	article39.txt
“the WHO measures air pollution by the mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter. These are the particles that cause diseases of all sorts and are responsible for most deaths by air pollution. According to the WHO, exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke and lung cancer. The report […] found that the United States was one of the most pollution-free nations in the world.”	The particulate matter (PM) discussion is essentially correct. PM is indeed thought to cause far more deaths than any other air pollutant. The United States indeed has lower PM2.5 levels than most other countries, especially when comparing cities. Most of the country outside California attains EPA’s 12 ug/m3 PM2.5 standard. “Most pollution-free” is poorly worded, since of course no populated area is ‘pollution-free’. But yes, PM2.5 levels in urban and rural areas of the United States are lower than those in corresponding areas of many other countries. The article misleads by conflating levels of air pollution with terminology like “most polluting” or “biggest polluters”. Relatively clean air quality in the United States does not negate the fact that we are the world’s second largest emitter of CO2.	
“Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming, cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable, annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015. At four degrees, the deadly European heat wave of 2003, which killed as many as 2,000 people a day, will be a normal summer. At six[…] summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley, and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone, anywhere, in the world today[…].”	“At two degrees… at four… at six” What is missing here is a discussion of the probabilities of each target, depending on emission scenarios, etc… It’s fine to discuss high-end scenarios, but mentioning probabilities would add context—without deterring from discussing the extreme risks associated, I believe. In general, the language in this paragraph is dire, but, in my opinion, this is an underappreciated consequence of global warming, and the author does well to highlight it. It’s difficult to extrapolate future impacts from one-time events: the 2003 heatwave killed that many people in Europe because it was so far out from the usual distribution, and populations were poorly prepared. In a warmer future, preparedness and reactivity would arguably be improved, so impacts could be reduced.	
“Global warming under Paris pledges”	There is a risk that some people might confuse the term “Paris pledges” with the 1.5- and 2-degree C targets that came out of the Paris Agreement.	article66.txt
“Whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin, this year most has been at least two metres thick.”	Ruth Mottram, Martin Stendel, Peter Langen, Danish Meteorological Institute This is a misleading statement, as “extremely thin” is not defined and what is also not stated is that there were also substantial areas of much thicker ice in 2008. If we look at the total ice volume, which averages these effects out, on 1st May 2017 it was about 6% lower than the ice volume for the same date in 2008 according to the operational ocean and sea ice model. Again, in addition to air and ocean temperature, ice thickness depends on winds and ocean currents and shows large variations from year to year so choosing two years arbitrarily is misleading without considering the long term trend. 	
“the total area burned in the western United States over the past 33 years was double the size it would have been without any human-caused warming.”	I would say: “the total area burned in the western United States over the past 33 years was at least double the size it would have been without any human-caused warming.”	article75.txt
the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink.	Arctic sea ice is typically less than 4 m thick. The use of ‘ice cap’ traditionally implies a body of ice on land that covers less area than an ice sheet; however, the article discusses sea ice, not an ice cap, which is floating ice that forms due to freezing of surface water.	article33.txt
“The acceleration is making some scientists fear that Antarctica’s ice sheet may have entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration.”	It is clear that ongoing warming of the climate will pose major risks to the stability of ice sheets. However, this statement seems to have moved the story up a notch from what is actually written later in the article. There are two aspects to this: (1) the size of the area of concern (the whole of Antarctica rather than just parts), and (2) whether irreversible loss has already begun, as opposed to being an imminent risk. The article describes legitimate concerns that parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet are becoming vulnerable and hence may soon be at risk of starting an “unstoppable disintegration”, but the suggestion that this is actually already happening (and hence that major Antarctic ice loss is now avoidable) is far more speculative—as indeed the later parts of the article make clear. The phrase “entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration” is not the same as “becoming vulnerable to an unstoppable disintegration”, but the latter phrase would better represent what is said later in the article.	article62.txt
El Niño is characterized by a warming of the surface waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean	This should be “in the central and eastern-central equatorial Pacific”.	article115.txt
“with some of the world’s most arable land turning quickly to desert”	What regions? Is this a statement about the present, or the future? If about the present, I am unaware of major arable land regions currently facing desertification. Current drought trends—whether droughts, on the global scale, are increasing in extent and/or severity—and their future under global warming, is still somewhat uncertain and a topic of ongoing research.	
“The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero.”	he current understanding of interactions between the global carbon cycle and the climate system is that when global CO2 emissions are reduced to zero, the warming will remain approximately constant. This is very often confused by estimates of committed “warming in the pipeline” which instead of assuming that global emissions are reduced to zero, assume that concentrations (and therewith to a large degree forcing) are kept constant. Keeping CO2 concentrations constant would require continuous emissions of CO2 that perfectly counter the uptake by natural sinks. If CO2 emissions are reduced to zero, atmospheric CO2 concentrations will gradually decline. For heat-trapping emissions other than CO2, the requirement to reduce them to zero to stabilize warming depends on their residence time in the atmosphere. For gases and particles that only stay in the atmosphere for shorter time periods (days to a decade) achieving constant emissions would also achieve approximately stabilized warming.	article77.txt
“But a myth persists that is both unscientific and immoral to perpetuate: that the beneficial gas carbon dioxide ranks among hazardous pollutants. It does not.”	This is semantics. Some call carbon dioxide a “pollutant” and others don’t. What is relevant is that the huge amount of CO2 that humanity has put into the atmosphere is changing the climate significantly. The hazard comes from changes to precipitation and extremes, leading to reduced food security and water availability. No wonder the Pentagon rates climate change as a critical threat to US national security. Just look at what’s happening in Syria and north Africa, on the back of a severe drought and a spike in food prices.

“Right now, the shelf works like a giant bottle-stopper that slows down ice trying to flow from the land into the sea. If it collapses, the ice could flow into the ocean more rapidly, an effect that has already happened on a much smaller scale in other areas of Antarctica. The most vulnerable parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet could raise the sea level by 10 to 15 feet, inundating many of the world’s coastal cities, though most scientists think that would take well over a century, or perhaps longer. They are worried about a possible rise of as much as six feet by the end of this century.”	Timothy Osborn, Professor, University of East Anglia, and Director of Research, Climatic Research Unit: This is correct but unclear. What is “perhaps longer” than “well over a century”? Given the importance of timescale for how coastal cities will respond to sea level rise, the range of possible timescales should be more explicit. IPCC AR5 WGI Chapter 13 on Sea Level Change assesses these as “sea level rise of 1 to 3 m per degree of warming is projected if the warming is sustained for several millennia (low confidence)”.

By 2050 there’s a scientific consensus that we reached the tipping point for ice sheets in Greenland and the West Antarctic well before 2°C (3.6°F) of warming	This is somewhat unclear phrasing from the report. Although studies have shown it is possible that the threshold for the Greenland Ice Sheet tipping point may be lower than 2C global warming (relative to pre-industrial), there is not currently a scientific consensus that this is where the threshold is. It seems to authors’ scenario is that scientists living in 2050 have reached the consensus that the tipping point has been passed by that time, but that’s different – again it’s part of the scenario and does not support the “end of civilisation by 2050” headline. 	
The Rio Grande is a classic “feast or famine” river, with a dry year or two typically followed by a couple of wet years that allow for recovery.	Weird wording. It’s just an arid river with high inter-annual variability in precipitation and flows.	
Deadly heat conditions across West Africa persist for over 100 days a year	The deadly heat projections (this, and the one from the previous paragraph) come from Mora et al (2017)1. It should be clarified that “deadly heat” here means heat and humidity beyond a two-dimension threshold where at least one person in the region subject to that heat and humidity dies (i.e., not everyone instantly dies). That said, in my opinion, the projections in Mora et al are conservative and the methods of Mora et al are sound. I did not check the claims in this report against Mora et al but I have no reason to think they are in error. 1- Mora et al (2017) Global risk of deadly heat, Nature Climate Change 	article127.txt
Globally averaged thermometers show two periods of warming since 1900: a half-degree from natural causes in the first half of the 20th century, before there was an increase in industrial carbon dioxide that was enough to produce it, and another half-degree in the last quarter of the century.	To be clear, that is half a degree Celsius, a full degree Fahrenheit.	article130.txt
“But as the ice age ended and the oceans warmed, all of them collapsed.”	“But as the ice age ended and the oceans warmed, all of them collapsed.” “Collapse” is commonly taken to mean “fail suddenly and completely”, but in the context of ice sheets the scientific use of “collapse” can encompass much longer timescales (even multiple centuries) and it would be informative to make this clear. For example, IPCC AR5 WGI (Chapter 13 on sea level change) use it this way: “Future climate forcing could trigger such an unstable collapse, which may then continue independently of climate. This potential collapse might unfold over centuries for individual bedrock troughs in West Antarctica and sectors of East Antarctica.” Without this clarification, “collapse” may be misinterpreted to mean something happening over timescales of a single decade or much shorter timescales—especially when combined with earlier language about refugees “fleeing inland” due to a “rapid disintegration”	article62.txt
“over 20 years of almost no change in temperatures”	Bastos There has been a slow-down in global mean surface (troposphere) temperatures, but this does not call into question the fact that the Earth-system as a whole is warming. In fact, during the so-called “hiatus”, the net radiation imbalance in the top of the atmosphere persisted (implying that warming would continue even if emissions were to stop). In fact, at the same time that warming in the troposphere stalled, ocean heat content increased, especially in deeper layers: The fact that oceans took more heat from the atmosphere helps to explain the slow-down of warming at the surface. This seems to be, at least partly, explained by natural variability in the ocean (see here). Trenberth* argued, thus, that natural variability in the climate system makes the global mean surface temperature record increase in steps, rather than in a linear way. In another study, Yan and colleagues* analysed the redistribution of heat during the “hiatus” period and concluded that: “[…] the term ‘global warming hiatus’ is a misnomer, although we will continue to use the widely used phrase to describe the slowdown or pause in the increase of GMST in the late 20th to early 21st century, with quotation marks. Alternatively, we would like to suggest to the climate community to use ‘global surface warming slowdown’ instead in the future to avoid confusion. There is no absolute consensus on the specific oceanic sink for the excess heat that led to the slowdown in rising GMST (the Southern Ocean may be worth further attention though), but there is a general agreement in this group and in the literature that rather than a ‘global warming hiatus,’ the slowdown of GMST increase in 1998–2013 was a result of the increased uptake of heat energy by the global ocean during those years.” Trenberth (2015) Has there been a hiatus?, Science Yan et al (2016) The global warming hiatus: Slowdown or redistribution?, Earth’s Future 	article76.txt
The idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth is among the most egregious manipulations of data in the absurd global warming debate.	Just to be clear, the main claim of climate science is that the global average temperature is increasing. The increase of heat waves is one of the many consequences of this. The article confusingly uses the term “record” in two meanings. The term records can be used for the observations that were recorded by meteorologists over the last centuries. The term “records” is mostly used for the highest or lowest value ever seen. In an article about the highest and lowest temperatures, it is best to avoid using the term records for the recorded data. The article also confusingly keeps on jumping between claims about local records in daily mean temperatures and claims about the long-term global mean temperature. Local temperatures are by their nature more variable than global average temperatures, daily temperatures are by their nature more variable than long-term average temperatures, records are by their nature more random than averages. With all the extra variability in the local daily records the authors can easily cherry pick a few data points that fit their narrative. What would make their case stronger would be if they actually analysed all the data, engaged with the existing scientific literature and made their own contribution to our scientific understanding by publishing a scientific paper. The cherry picking exercise in this Western Journal article does not contribute to our scientific understanding of the world.	article124.txt
“about 56 million years ago … The planet proceeded to warm rapidly, at least in geologic terms, and major die-offs of some marine organisms followed due to strong acidification of the oceans.” 	The event was a “strong acidification” event relative to changes that ordinarily occur over geologic time but it was a weak event compared to what our modern industrial society is threatening to produce. If anything, Chris Mooney is erring on the side of downplaying risks from ocean acidification by saying that “major die-offs” were associated with a “strong acidification” event, when in fact they have been associated with events that are far weaker than we will produce with continued burning of coal, oil, and gas.
