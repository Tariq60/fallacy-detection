“CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent.”	While it is true that carbon dioxide constitutes about 400 ppm (or 0.04%) of the atmosphere, the implication that this means it is insignificant in Earth’s climate is incorrect. It is the ability of a gas to absorb radiation, and so affect energy balance of the Earth, not its concentration, which is important. This effect on Earth’s energy balance can be quantified by the radiative forcing (RF); a positive RF means a surface warming effect and a negative RF a cooling. The figure below, from the 2013 IPCC report shows estimates of RF for a range of factors which have influenced climate from 1750-2011. As can be seen, increasing carbon dioxide concentrations have the largest RF and therefore the largest impact on climate. I also stress that knowledge of the important role of carbon dioxide (despite its low concentration) in Earth’s climate is not new, and dates back to the work of Tyndall, Arrhenius, and others in the 19th century.
“This is happening even as the overall warming of the planet may, by lengthening growing seasons and moistening the atmosphere, further stoke plant growth.”	… note that relative humidity over land, near the surface, is projected to decrease with global warming (i.e., humidity increases more slowly than temperature over land). This has been observed in the past 10-15 years (although the role of variability is still unclear). So “moistening of the atmosphere”, as far as vegetation is concerned, is not accurate (at least globally). See: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/2013-state-climate-humidity 
“While the United States must remain vigilant to keep the level of real, dangerous pollutants to a minimum, it may take some consolation in the fact that among G7 nations, it has the cleanest air of all.”	Carbon dioxide is a well-mixed greenhouse gas—its concentrations are roughly 407 ppm everywhere across the globe. The national concentration bears absolutely no relevance to the country’s emissions.
“The most dramatic impacts may not be felt for 50 or 100 years.”	While the most dramatic effects may not be felt until 50 to 100 years from now, that does not mean that dramatic impacts will not occur before then.
From 1970 until 1998 there was a warming period that raised temperatures by about 0.7 F that helped spawn the global warming alarmist movement. However, since 1998, little warming has occurred while carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase.	Warming rate from 1970-1998: +0.15 C/decade, 95 % confidence interval +/- 0.06 C/decade. Warming rate from 1998-2018: +0.18 C/decade, 95 % confidence interval +/- 0.09 C/decade. (Calculated with Berkeley Earth). Odds are that warming after 1998 was faster than warming before 1998. Anyone who looks into the data and has basic analysis skills can see this, so they would not even try to imply that 1970-1998 warming was faster than post-1998 warming. The whole article uses tricks like this to invert reality, and will leave readers deeply deceived. 
“Policy makers who want to help the residents of the Marshall Islands today should look at improving the islands’ resilience”	This is a classic technique in Lomborg’s articles: he focuses on one small aspect of climate change – here the Marshall Islands, other times maybe polar bears or heat-related human deaths – that i) he passes off as the main concern about global warming, and ii) that he can provide some seemingly contradictory information about… All the other consequences of global warming are conveniently set aside… Red herring.
“The list of variables that shape climate […] would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision.”	Jacoby is making a laundry list, not trying to understand the issues. He is also confusing the issue by trying to claim that since scientists cannot predict climate change at a given small location at a fixed point in future time that they do not have the ability to generally predict the the future trend. Climate scientists are after the trend. Most of the variables he mentions cause the local climate to deviate to a small extent from the trend. Some, like volcanic activity or El Niño, affect the climate for a small number of years, and then their effect disappears.
Yes, you read that correctly, three million — million — years ago CO2 levels on Earth were the same as they are today, but there is one major difference between three million years ago and today…	The author writes this as if this is something that is a surprise. We all know that the Earth’s CO2 levels were higher at various times in the past. In the Eocene, 50 million years ago, they may have even been four times as high. This is not an issue. In the past, rates of volcanic CO2 emissions globally were higher as continental spreading rates changed, for example. Saying that CO2 isn’t rising now due to humans just because it used to be high in the past is like saying “I didn’t chop the cherry tree down because 40 years ago there was never a cherry tree there”. It is totally unrelated.
“‘The Arctic may be remote, but changes that occur there directly affect us. The melting of the Greenland ice sheet is already contributing significantly to sea level rise, and new research is highlighting that the melting of Arctic sea ice can alter weather conditions across Europe, Asia and North America.’”	There is indeed observational evidence that melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which contributes to global sea level rise, has accelerated in recent years. While scientists are still intensively investigating the details, it is also true that recent research* suggests that the loss of Arctic sea ice will mostly likely influence weather patterns in mid-latitude regions (including much of Europe, Asia, and North America).

“The science is far from settled.”	The basic controls on the climate, sunlight and greenhouse gases, have been understood for over a century and are not disputed. The frontiers of climate research are where the debates lie, as with any branch of science.
“What are the odds that a climate model built on a system that simple would be reliable? Less than 50/50. (Multiplying .95 by itself 15 times yields 46.3 percent.)”	This is absolutely not how prediction skills are and should be measured. Assuming that each variable is given the same weight, the initial error would be of 5%. How this error grows with the prediction is a nontrivial problem, which cannot be explained by kindergarten probabilities, but requires observations, theory and modeling. Moreover, the problem of the predictability of fast weather fluctuations become irrelevant for long-term climate projections of statistics in response to forcing.
Now the states rely on the weather and compete to reach the bottom. South Australia is winning: it has the most unreliable grid in the world outside Africa and the most expensive electricity. When South Australians buy electricity at $14,200/MWh, they are paying the equivalent of $400 a litre for petrol.	Mark Diesendorf, Associate Professor, UNSW Sydney The comments about South Australia are misleading. SA has the same reliability as the rest of the Australian National Electricity Market. On average, SA has always had the highest electricity prices of the Australian states, long before wind power made a significant contribution, because of SA’s high dependence on high-priced natural gas. The growth of wind power has actually reduced the wholesale price of electricity in SA compared with what it would have been in the absence of wind. This is a consequence of the Merit Order Effect: wind and solar can bid into the grid at zero, or close to zero, price, because they have no fuel cost. The figure $14,200/MWh is grossly misleading. It’s the price during a rare peak in demand when supply was low. Similar high peak prices have occurred occasionally in the other states. It’s not typical of SA.
“What do you say to people who theorize that the Earth as it continues to warm is returning to its normal temperature?”	This is a fallacy, which has been correctly rebutted by Duffy. What matters is that a large increase in global temperatures is problematic for us humans, who have built a civilisation in a relatively stable climate, and which we are now perturbing far outside this stable range.
“The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever. Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.”	This statement is absolutely ridiculous. It violates the most basic, fundamental maxim of toxicology, first articulated by the Renaissance physician Paracelsus: “The dose makes the poison.” Or, “All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not a poison.” In other words, just because a substance at one concentration is harmless does not mean it is harmless at another concentration. We don’t normally think of consumption of water as harmful to humans, but at high enough doses it will kill—and has done so. A pollutant is generally defined as a substance—artificial (synthetic) or natural—that occurs in the environment at least in part because of human activity, and that has a deleterious impact on living systems. Given that basic definition, there is no way that CO2 can not be a pollutant. It is produced by a variety of human activities, but principally burning of fossil fuels. Increases in its concentration are clearly linked to global warming, which has already, and increasingly will, negatively affect living systems, including humans. The only exit from this logic is to deny that CO2 leads to warming (in contradiction to massive scientific evidence) or to deny that warming negatively impacts living systems (again in contradiction to massive evidence). The authors use a classic rhetorical ploy to confound bits of information and draw erroneous conclusions. Yes, at low concentrations CO2 is not directly harmful to humans, and in fact is required by plants. And yes, small increases in CO2 have been shown to increase plant growth. (Some of my own work has shown such; such increases also shift the chemical composition of plant tissues, and not always for the better!). Plants grown under elevated CO2 do grow faster. To my knowledge, there is no evidence that they are “stronger” (whatever that means), and if anything, they are less green. Nor is there convincing evidence they are healthier. If anything, insects consume them more than ambient-CO2 plants.
Isn’t it time to start ignoring the calamitous annual claims that this is the hottest year on record?	This is again a claim about the annual mean temperature, not about local daily maxima. 2018 was the fourth warmest year. With the last five years being the five warmest years we have a real problem. Putting your head in the sand does not protect what we hold dear.
“Peter Wadhams, professor of ocean physics at the University of Cambridge, predicted ‘global disaster’ from the demise of Arctic sea ice—in four years. He too, is eating crow.”	Indeed. Wadham’s claims have been roundly refuted by the climate science community. They are certainly an example of exaggeration, but to suggest that they somehow represent the scientific mainstream is a great distortion. [See Climate Feedback review of the latest prediction by P. Wadhams]
Did the Earth experience its highest temperature ever this year? The answer is no.	Does this have any significant bearing on the steadily increasing ocean heat content and annual mean global surface temperature? The answer is no.
[data] show only slight warming, mostly at night and in winter	This is something that is also simulated in climate models (larger warming in the minimum daily temperature than the maximum daily temperature). The article the authors reference tends to focus on smaller spatial scales where natural variability plays a larger role. On a global scale, the seasonal asymmetry in warming rates appears to be small. Taking global GISTEMP trends over 1950 – 2018 the range of trends for all seasons is 0.13 – 0.15 degrees C per decade.

“Lake-bottom sediments in Florida tell us that recent major hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico has been less frequent than in centuries past.”	The lake-bottom sediment study, in which I participated, catalogued hurricanes at a particular location over several thousand years. There are indeed centennial-scale variations at particular locations that are not strongly correlated across different locations, so the authors interpreted these fluctuations in terms of changing [hurricane] tracks. The technique cannot distinguish between a weak event nearby and a strong one at a distance, so there is little data pertaining to storm intensity.
“Ever since 2012, scientists have been debating a complex and frankly explosive idea about how a warming planet will alter our weather — one that, if it’s correct, would have profound implications across the Northern Hemisphere and especially in its middle latitudes”	This is a somewhat misleading intro. The debate has been focused on winter storms (as Mooney discusses below), and these new results are strictly for boreal summer/spring.
“In the geological past, Earth’s atmosphere had hundreds of times the CO2 content of the modern atmosphere yet there were no carbon dioxide-driven catastrophes. The past shows that climate change is normal, that warmer times and more atmospheric carbon dioxide have driven biodiversity and that cold times kill.”	There are many problems with this statement, starting with an entire lack of accuracy. It reads like a series of generic statements that can easily be taken out of context and are entirely irrelevant to the problem at hand. One particularly striking point is the implicitly obvious lack of awareness for timescales. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are changing at unprecedented rates now, posing a serious threat to biodiversity in rapidly changing ecosystems.
“Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years. If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet, are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade?”	Sea level rise and its impacts vary considerably by region. To state a global mean number is misleading and irrelevant to those regions that are most vulnerable. With or without hurricanes added to the mix, the impacts on humans from sea level rise can be seen now. The author’s comparison of hurricane storm surge to sea level rise is very misleading and blurs the relevance of sea level rise to humans. Sea level rise is creating nuisance flooding in a number of places. The fact that hurricane storm surge is bigger is irrelevant and does not change the fact that people are being impacted. 
Since then, the planet has been cooling on a millennial scale	Here the author is muddling the issue of climate change by introducing time periods that are unrelated. Human-caused climate change via significant greenhouse gas emissions as discussed today only refers to the last roughly 100 years. This human activity has completely altered the Earth’s climate from any natural trend that may occur over 1,000s of years. The “millenial” scale is not relevant to the discussion of current human-caused climate change.
“The research challenges the ways that researchers have worked out sea temperatures until now, meaning that they may be increasing quicker than previously suggested.”	There is no link between the method the paper studies to construct past temperature changes (oxygen isotopes in foraminifera) and present temperature increase (measured using satellites, direct measurements and other proxies).
Some regions experience more, some less and some no trend. Limitations of data and inconsistencies in patterns prevent confident claims about global trends one way or another.	Confidence is often low due to the limited data availability. As also stated by the IPCC, low confidence does not necessarily imply that a link does not exist.
This requires us to work towards avoiding catastrophic possibilities rather than looking at probabilities, as learning from mistakes is not an option when it comes to existential risks.	The report focuses on possible scenarios very much on the extreme end of what could happen but then claims there’s a “high likelihood” of human civilisation ending. These two statements don’t fit together.
“Consider where they move. Migration patterns show people heading for warm states like Texas and Florida, not snowy Minnesota and Michigan.”	People don’t like the cold, they like sunshine and warmth, and (supposedly as a result, according to Lomborg), they move to the South: does Lomborg really want us to deduce from that that global warming will thus be good for us – even simply in terms of temperature-related deaths? That’s not reasonable. First, while people have indeed generally been moving from the North(-East) to the South over the last decades, it’s not only because of “better climate”: quoting this article by the Washington Post, “Several long-term trends dating as far back as the 1960s are behind this larger pattern. The rise of air conditioning and interstate highways have made once-sleepy (and sweltering) Southern cities more appealing. And, over the same time, the decline of industrial jobs in the Midwest and Northeast have pushed people out. Cheap housing during the boom years also drove growth in states such as Arizona and Nevada“. I think that is already much more reasonable than saying that people move South only because they know they are less likely to die from cold exposure there. Second, people may be moving there right now partly because of climate, and that may indeed be a “smart” move because, TODAY, indeed, current cold-related deaths outnumber heat-related deaths. However, even supposing that this is a significant factor in their decision process, it’s not clear that they are also thinking about future warming. So the fact that people are moving there NOW does not even logically imply, as Lomborg would have it, that FUTURE warming will be beneficial – which is the point of interest here.
“collaborating on studies which all corroborate, independently and rigorously, the increasingly respectable view that ‘man-made global warming’ just isn’t a thing.”	This false statement is based on a list of figures taken completely out of context. For instance, No Tricks Zone [the blog Breitbart is using as a source] takes a figure from Markle et al., (2017)1 and assumes the x-axis refers to years before present. With this incorrect interpretation, it seems as though ocean temperature anomalies are very low at year 0. However, these plots show the result of simulations of idealized Dansgaard-Oeschger or Antarctic Isotope Maximum events in a general circulation model. Year 0 is simply the beginning of the simulated event and is not displaying actual modern sea surface temperature data (i.e. year 0 is not today, 0 years before present). Not only is this a red herring, it is a completely misinterpreted red herring. They also repeat the favorite Antarctic cooling cherry, taking (and altering) a figure from Mayewski et al., (2017)2 which shows Antarctic-wide climate reanalysis temperature data. As a continent (larger than the US lower-48), Antarctica is not warming. This is because much of high, dry East Antarctica is not warming. However, important areas of Antarctica, including West Antarctica which likely would show about a 0.2ºC per decade warming trend over the reanalysis period (from 1979 to present, since satellites have given good data coverage). Climate is incredibly variable around Antarctica, and also through time (large interannual variability). This is well studied, but if you only look at one graph rather than reading the research papers you will not be aware of this.

“The thermal expansion of the oceans, compounded by melting glaciers, resulted in the highest global sea level on record in 2015.”	This statement in the AMS report refers to the satellite altimetry record, which reaches back to 1993. It is also important to remember that it refers to the global average sea level. We do have local records of past sea level that extend further back in time, for instance tide gauge records or inferences based upon biological markers. For instance, combined tide gauge records have been used to infer global mean sea level rise (GMSL) over the 20th century and into the 21st century. The obtained estimate of the GMSL rise agrees with the satellite altimetry record in their overlap since 1993 (e.g., Hay et al., 2015: Probabilistic reanalysis of twentieth-century sea-level rise).
“the satellites now show that in recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more that [sic] 0.6 degrees”	While temperatures have declined modestly from the peak of the El Niño event, this is expected behavior, particularly in satellite records where El Niño is amplified. However, temperatures in January through April are quite above average to-date, and while we may not set a record temperature in 2017 compared to 2016, it will very likely be the second warmest year on record (at least on the surface). Through present there is no sign of any sort of pause or slowdown in any of the surface records or one of the two satellite records (the RSS groups latest version 4 record). The only record showing a continued pause is the one produced by the University of Alabama, Huntsville (the UAH record). The differences between these records and their causes is an area of active research, though we have strong reason to suspect that the surface record is quite accurate. 
“CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent.”	First, it is true that water vapor constitutes the bulk of Earth’s present-day greenhouse effect (measured in terms of infrared absorption). Quantitatively, however, Jacoby is off by quite a bit. In fact, water vapor constitutes ~50% of the terrestrial greenhouse effect, not 95% (see here*). Clouds (solid and liquid water that form when the vapor condenses) constitute another ~25%, but CO2 contributes to almost all of the remaining fraction (only ~5% or so from all of the other combined gases). This is because CO2 still absorbs well in spectral regions where water vapor doesn’t, and also because the upper troposphere is very dry; the ability to absorb intense surface emission and re-emit it at colder, higher layers of the atmosphere is critical for the maintenance of a planetary greenhouse effect. Secondly, the water vapor greenhouse effect is not independent of the CO2 in the atmosphere. Jacoby stresses that CO2 is only a trace component of the atmosphere, an argument that is irritatingly unoriginal and provides useless context when describing the flow of radiation through the atmosphere. As before, CO2 accounts for ~20% of Earth’s greenhouse effect. N2 and O2 account for nearly all of Earth’s atmospheric mass. However, if the atmosphere were purely N2 and O2, the planet would likely be in a snowball state due to the lack of greenhouse trapping. This is where the equations of radiative transfer must be applied, rather than a naive intuition about proportions.

“‘If you remove the ice shelf, there’s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities,’ says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge. This signals the possible rapid destabilization of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet in this century.”	Multiple studies have indicated that the marine ice sheet instability is likely already underway in the Pine Island region1,2. There has been no evidence to suggest that the loss of ice from this region will stop. However, that the loss of ice from marine ice sheet instability is underway does NOT mean that the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet will destabilize this century. There is no evidence for the ice loss to occur that quickly. 1- Joughin et al (2014) Marine Ice Sheet Collapse Potentially Under Way for the Thwaites Glacier Basin, West Antarctica, Science 2- Rignot et al (2014) Widespread, rapid grounding line retreat of Pine Island, Thwaites, Smith, and Kohler glaciers, West Antarctica, from 1992 to 2011, Geophysical Research Letters 
One of the main areas of contention is the existence of two strange climate episodes known as The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age. The MWP lasted from about 950 to 1250AD, and temperature records appear to show it was even hotter than today	These periods are now well understood to be, at best, regional phenomena rather than global-scale changes. Indeed, it is the broad global nature of the recently observed changes that make them unusual. The realisation of these being largely regional phenomena centred on the N. Atlantic region has led to a growing deprecation of these terms.
“ever since December temperatures in the Arctic have consistently been lower than minus 20 C”	It is indeed true that the Arctic is cold in winter—it’s hard to argue with that. But this statement belies the fact that winter 2017 was actually extraordinarily warm by historical standards, and second only to the record-shattering warmth observed just last year (in 2016). The attached plot, created by Zachary Labe and available at http://sites.uci.edu/zlabe/arctic-temperatures, shows that the -20 °C temperatures this winter are nearly 10 °C degrees above the long-term average of -30 °C! Therefore, the fact that temperatures were -20 °C this winter in the Arctic is actually a testament to just how much the Arctic has warmed in recent years. 
“there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.” How is this possible 2,999,971 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger bought his Hummer?	What this study tells us is that the last time CO2 was as high as 410 ppm (back then through natural causes), there was no ice on Greenland or West Antarctica. What this means is that we can potentially expect (once the climate has equilibrated to its new CO2 levels) that these ice bodies will melt in the future from anthropogenic CO2 release. If this happens, the sea level will rise by metres, and many coastal and lowland cities will be affected. In a way I have to profess my admiration- how a news outlet could take a paper presenting evidence that we should be very worried about CO2 being 410 ppm, and turns it into a paper that “debunks climate change”, is beyond me. It really is a feat that must have taken a lot of imagination and creative thinking.
“Climate Models Have Overestimated Global Warming”	The title does not truly reflect the article in Nature Geoscience. The issue is not that the models are too warm by 2015. CMIP5 models are on the warm end, yes, but that’s not the main issue here. The article explains that problem comes when looking at both cumulative CO2 emissions and associated warming. The cumulative CO2 emissions simulated by the models only reach 545 GtC (the present-day value) after 2020, by which time the CMIP5 ensemble-mean human- induced warming is over 0.3 ºC warmer than the central estimate for human-induced warming to 2015.
“This means it is possible that by some yardsticks, 2016 will be declared as hot as 2015 or even slightly hotter – because El Nino did not vanish until the middle of the year.”	Even without the big El Niño spike, 2016 will be the hottest year on record, and 2015 the second hottest. Scientists have methods to remove the effect of El Niño on the temperature record. We can also see this in a simple example where we just remove the big El Niño-related temperature spike, but 2016 remains the warmest year in the surface temperature record: 
“While France and other G7 countries lamented the U.S. exit from the Paris climate accord, America’s air is already cleaner than that of any other country in the G7, except Canada with its scant population.”	The Breitbart author must know that the Paris Agreement is about climate change, not about air quality.
“This past winter, a string of days 60 and 70 degrees warmer than normal baked the North Pole”	Regions with open water will stay relatively warm due to the relatively warm water. As soon as ice limits heat flows from the ocean to the atmosphere it can get very cold. Also, in general variability is much stronger in the Arctic—what sounds like a really big warm anomaly to an innocent reader in the USA is thus exceptional, but less so than the numbers suggest. That is context a reader would need to know. Steffensen et al (2008) High-Resolution Greenland Ice Core Data Show Abrupt Climate Change Happens in Few Years, Science 
Biological, geological and planetary systems are extremely robust. Our evolving dynamic planet has survived sea level changes of hundreds of metres	This is a non-sequitur. Just because the physical Earth system still functions after major climatic changes, doesn’t mean that we as humans should not be concerned about its impacts on our civilization.
“While evidence that the earth’s orbital variations impact radiation levels and thus global temperatures does not of course mean that man is not in some way impacting the climate, studies like these highlight that the role man plays on the planet is dwarfed by natural phenomena utterly out of our control.”	I’m not sure how they come to this conclusion. The increase in global temperature from the depth of the last glacial (22,000 years ago) to preindustrial times is about 4.5°C. This is less than the warming projected for the end of the century, if we choose to ignore man’s responsibility as the author suggests. Clearly if we do act to limit the warming to 2°C, then the glacial change would be bigger than it, but the timespans involved mean that current climate change is still a happening at a faster rate.
“But some research suggests that a catastrophe might not yet be inevitable. In a study last year, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and David Pollard of Pennsylvania State University used their computer model to predict what would happen if emissions were reduced sharply over the next few decades, in line with international climate goals. Under the most ambitious scenarios, they found a strong likelihood that Antarctica would remain fairly stable.”	To my mind, the way this is written gives the impression that the DeConto and Pollard study is the outlier and that a substantial body of research suggest that a catastrophe is already inevitable—however, the article has not actually given any details of any such research, it only raised the possibility of unstoppable disintegration as a research question. It would be far more accurate to say that the vast majority of research does not suggest that a catastrophe is inevitable. 
I note particularly that sea-level rise is not affected by the warming; it continues at the same rate, 1.8 millimeters a year, according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr.	This is very misleading. Why is the author using a review dating from 1990, when there have been many publications over the past 28 years that show a much higher rate of Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) rise over the last few decades? For instance, Hay et al* have looked at tide gauge records since the beginning of the 20th century and found that the rate of GMSL rise was 1.2 +/- 0.2 mm/yr over the 1901-1990 period, but 3.0 +/- 0.7 mm/yr over the 1993-2010 period (this period corresponds to the time for which we also have satellite altimetry measurements, which are consistent with this rate). The author also talks about an “accelerating rate” of sea-level rise later in his article, which contradicts his own statement. Hay et al (2015) Probabilistic reanalysis of twentieth-century sea-level rise, Nature 
“a warming planet causes our weather to become more stuck in place”	This claim is somewhat overly confident given the available evidence. Observational studies (e.g. Francis and Vavrus 2015*) do indeed suggest that the “waviness” of the jet stream and subsequently the propensity for weather patterns to become more persistent has increased in certain regions and during certain seasons, although this is not universally true. There is also emerging evidence that the rapid warming of the Arctic may be playing a role in creating the conditions favorable for weather patterns to become “stuck in place”—a hypothesis that the new Mann et al. 2017* paper discussed in the article supports. The connections between amplified Arctic warming and mid-latitude weather extremes remains a very active area of scientific research (Overland et al. 2016*), however, and considerable uncertainty regarding the magnitude and mechanisms of this effect remain.
