“The ‘ancient carbon’ of Alaska’s tundras is being released, starting a vicious warming cycle ‘This is ancient carbon, thousands and millions of years old.’ It’s being released ‘much earlier than we thought.”	This is an interesting headline and quote. The article in PNAS uses atmospheric measurements of CO2 to derive sources and sinks from tundra and boreal forests. The study does not say that “this is ancient carbon, thousands and millions year old”… It could be, but there is no evidence for this in the paper. The paper only shows that atmospheric measurements indicate that Alaskan ecosystems have been a source of carbon in recent years (2012 to 2014).
“Or the news from Antarctica this past May, when a crack in an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days, then kept going; the break now has just three miles to go — by the time you read this, it may already have met the open water, where it will drop into the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever, a process known poetically as ‘calving.’”	Although a particularly dramatic and well-observed example of how floating ice shelves calve icebergs into the ocean, there is little evidence that the crack in the Larsen C ice shelf is directly related to climate change. At best this is subject to considerable debate, as it is difficult to directly connect particular atmospheric and oceanic mechanisms to the cracking of this single, albeit large, proto-iceberg. For a very measured treatment of this topic, see the Guardian article by Professor Helen Fricker of Scripps Institute of Oceanography. Having now just calved an iceberg as of July 12, it is good to hear from the most experience experts how concerning this event is. A really great simple summary is provided by David Vaughan, Director of Science for the British Antarctic Survey, who has worked on the Antarctic Peninsula and studied regional ice shelves for decades. 
“Ice-free means the central basin of the Arctic will be ice-free and I think that that is going to happen in summer 2017 or 2018.”	There is no reason to believe that the sea ice cover will disappear this quickly. Our best estimate for this comes from climate models projections, which show that the Arctic could become ice free (less than a million square km) by mid-century — at the earliest — under business-as-usual emissions. Observations show that sea ice is declining somewhat faster than models predict, but even accounting for this suggests that an ice-free Arctic is decades away. 
“What we don’t hear from her is that fewer people will die from cold.”	Every report I have ever read about the impacts of climate change on temperature-related deaths discuss both the impacts of heat and cold. Such as the new USGCRP Health report: “Based on present-day sensitivity to heat, an increase of thousands to tens of thousands of premature heat-related deaths in the summer [Very Likely, High Confidence] and a decrease of premature cold-related deaths in the winter [Very Likely, Medium Confidence] are projected each year as a result of climate change by the end of the century. Future adaptation will very likely reduce these impacts (see Changing Tolerance to Extreme Heat Finding). The reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions [Likely, Medium Confidence].” Climate Feedback: This claim is not supported by available evidence and has been thoroughly discussed in a previous Climate Feedback analysis of an op-ed by Bjorn Lomborg.
“Ice-free means the central basin of the Arctic will be ice-free and I think that that is going to happen in summer 2017 or 2018.”	It is not clear whether a permanent or a one-year phenomenon is meant here (probably the former), but in any case the scientific support for the claim is weak. In the former case (permanent disappearance), this would not correspond to what most sea ice experts do consider. Indeed, section 11.3.4.1 of the last (2013) IPCC assessment report suggests a very low probability for permanent disappearance within the current decade. In fact, from the scientific literature it seems the phenomenon is more likely to take place during the period 2040-2060. Of course, a very low probability does not necessarily mean a zero probability, and IPCC’s report could possibly underestimate the odds for disappearance within the next few years. But before propagating a marginal view (relative to IPCC conclusions), one should ensure having a very strong argumentation; in this interview no argumentation is put forward to support Peter Wadhams’ central claim. In the other possible case (isolated single-year disappearance), it has to be said sea ice has strong year-to-year variability superimposed on its long-term declining trend, and no one has the tools to precisely predict the outcome one year in advance. Seasonal-to-decadal prediction groups equipped with physically-based models have some potential prediction skill for lead times up to 12-24 months, but they currently cannot guarantee to be right for any specific forecast (e.g.: Seasonal Forecasts of the Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Extent Using a GCM-Based Seasonal Prediction System and Pan-Arctic and Regional Sea Ice Predictability: Initialization Month Dependence). So, if it turns out in 2017 or 2018 that Wadhams was right, it will have been luck more than justified certainty. 
can today’s climate models be trusted when scientists have misrepresented the data in the past?	A strangely (deliberately?) vague swipe at climate science. The author presents no evidence that scientists have intentionally misrepresented “the data” in the past, or which data this refers to (either here, or later in the article). 
Sadly, these supposed experts use mathematical equations that do not jibe with reality over the past 140 years.	Experts tend to use mathematical equations. If the authors would like to claim an equation is wrong, they should state which one and provide a source. Otherwise it is just hot air.
“Nor have various calamities that were supposed to have occurred by now materialized.”	We predicted, 31 years ago, that hurricane intensity would increase with greenhouse gas concentrations. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan set the world record wind speed in a landfalling tropical cyclone, and in 2015 eastern North Pacific Hurricane Patricia set an all time record for hurricane winds. Hurricane Irma of 2017 maintained category 5 status for longer than any storm on record. Do tell the residents of Tacloban, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands that they have not experienced calamities.
Actual weather records over the past 100 years show no correlation between rising carbon dioxide levels and local temperatures.	Science only claims a relationship between carbon dioxide levels and the global temperature. Still, it would be nice if the authors would provide a source for their claim.
“If true, that means that the global warming we are currently undergoing is unparallelled within the last 100 million years”	The study suggests some periods of time may (according to one proxy) be cooler than originally thought, but this doesn’t change the “rate” of warming seen today. This isn’t anything to do with the study. There are confused messages coming out here about rate of change vs. absolute values. Certainly we are not reaching temperatures today that are warmer than over the last 100 million years, either with or without the results of this study.
“But scientific research indicates the world was last this warm about 115,000 years ago and that the planet has not experienced such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for 4m years.”	This statement is overly confident and not based on a broad consensus in the literature. Even the cited study states “we cannot be certain that the current year is warmer than any single year earlier in the Holocene due to centennial smoothing of the Holocene stack and original resolution of the underlying proxy records”. The most recent IPCC assessment indicates only moderate confidence that 1983-2012 was the warmest 30-year period in the last 1,400 years and limited this to the Northern Hemisphere rather than the global average.
“Venus, which was once a very Earth-like planet with plenty of life-supporting water before runaway climate change rapidly transformed it into an arid and uninhabitable sphere enveloped in an unbreathable gas”	My expertise is not in exoplanetary climate, but it is not a definitively accepted “fact” that Venus was once habitable. There is still considerable debate regarding the past habitability of Venus (see links below). Therefore, this statement (which appears to imply that Venus’s climate trajectory is foreshadowing for Earth’s) comes off way too strong.

“What we don’t hear from her is that fewer people will die from cold.”	“While it’s true that cold may kill more people today than heat, Lomborg’s assertion that climate change will result in fewer overall deaths in the U.S. this century from extreme temperatures is not supported by available evidence.”
“Fires have not only been increasing in size due to climate change. In the early 20th century, state and federal governments began aggressively fighting wildfires and trying to keep them as small as possible. This has caused denser and more fire-prone forests than the long-term average for the West, which has led to more massive and uncontrollable fires.”	This statement should have included a citation and also noted that the influence of fire suppression on subsequent fire activity varies with the frequency of historical fires. The century of fire suppression has potentially increased fuel accumulation in dry forests that historically experienced very frequent fires (e.g. every 5-20 years). On the other hand, fire suppression has likely had far less of an impact on wetter forests, such as those in coastal Oregon and Washington, that historically went centuries without fire.
“In the U.S. about 9,000 people die from heat each year but 144,000 die from cold.”	Where do these numbers come from? According to a review of national health statistics: During 2006–2010, about 2,000 U.S. residents died each year from weather-related causes. About 31% of these deaths were attributed to exposure to excessive natural heat, heat stroke, sun stroke, or all; 63% were attributed to exposure to excessive natural cold, hypothermia, or both; and the remaining 6% were attributed to floods, storms, or lightning. This statement also confuses seasonal mortality with mortality from extreme events. As noted in Ebi and Mills, this distinction is important for understanding what could happen with climate change.
“global warming causes about as much damage as benefits.”	This claim is not supported by any source. Read the IPCC synthesis report Summary for Policy-Makers (SPM) headlines for a balanced assessment: “Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.” …

“I would certainly not call such [superstorm] scenarios ridiculous,” said Coumou. “But it is speculative – we don’t have the hard evidence.”	The superstorm scenario rests on a number of assumptions, especially that the rate of ice melt from Greenland (and Antarctica) will accelerate very rapidly. Definitely still in the realm of speculation. 
“Furthermore, the overall increases in such things as hurricanes and tornadoes have not materialized.”	Again, this statement is not supported by the science. We are seeing changes. We just don’t have long enough data records to formally detect the changes and attribute them to human influence. The rules of detection and attribution are well established, strict, and conservative. The author’s statement here is outside of the rules and can’t be supported in any true formal scientific sense. […] It’s wrong and unsupportable to say that there have been no changes. Our theory of hurricanes and our best numerical models inform us that hurricanes will become stronger as the world warms, and that the increase will be most evident in the strongest hurricanes. These are the hurricanes that kill the most people and do the most damage. Furthermore, increases in strength or number are not the only ways that hurricanes can change. There is mounting evidence that tropical cyclones in various regions of the world are migrating poleward. This creates significant changes in hazard exposure and human mortality risk, even in the absence of any changes in strength.
The most recent IPCC report lays out a future if we limit global heating to 1.5°C instead of the Paris Agreement’s 2°C.	The article doesn’t mention it, but it’s worth pointing out that the underlying report criticizes the IPCC for being too “reticent” and gives an erroneous example: it claims that mean global temperatures will accelerate beyond the IPCC’s projections since human greenhouse gas emissions are themselves accelerating. Emissions ARE accelerating exponentially, leading to exponential CO2 atmospheric fraction increase, but exponential growth in CO2 fraction leads to linearly increasing global mean temperature.
[subsidies for wind and solar] add to emissions because coal-fired elec­tricity needs to be on standby for when there is no wind or sunshine. 	Baseless and, in regions where this has been studied, false. For example, in Illinois1. And this ignores more efficient ways of reducing backup emissions, such as energy storage like batteries. 1- Valentino et al (2012) System-Wide Emissions Implications of Increased Wind Power Penetration, Environmental Science & Technology 
“[…]looking to the future, mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef will likely be an annual phenomenon within a decade, Torda said.”	This may turn out to be true but most studies place annual bleaching, especially on the Great Barrier Reef, a bit further out—perhaps 2050. van Hooidonk et al (2013) Temporary refugia for coral reefs in a warming world, Nature Climate Change   
Skeptics claim such anomalies prove that Earth can quickly warm and cool even in the absence of carbon dioxide, and any warming today may be caused by similar natural events.	And climate scientists would agree—a large volcanic eruption will quickly (albeit temporarily) cool the Earth. Critically, there is zero evidence that present day warming is caused by anything other than human activity.
“All this could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years — much too quickly for humanity to adapt.”	This is a statement that is difficult to justify without a reference to scientific evidence. The current knowledge of time scales involved with rapid ice sheet loss is poor (i.e., solely based on ice sheet models that are crude)—that’s the primary reason why the “How Much How Fast” US-UK program was established.
Some experts think we’re on track to hit 550 ppm by the end of the century, which would cause average global temperatures to rise by 6 degrees Celsius	This assumes a very high climate sensitivity compared to most IPCC-class models. Can the authors give a source for where they got this estimate? It appears to be a quote from the previous link, which itself has no reference either. Most estimates tend to fall around 3 ˚C/doubling, and 550 is ~1 doubling of CO2 vs. pre-industrial of 280 ppm. So that would suggest ~3˚C total, of which maybe 1 ˚C has already happened. Maybe one saving grace here is that 550 ppm is perhaps one of the more conservative estimates for the end of the century.
“According to the satellites, the late 2016 temperatures are returning to the levels they were at after the 1998 El Nino.”	Not based on any evidence. Just like the warming peak due to El Niño was higher in 2016 than in 1998, the period after 2016 will be warmer than the years after 1998 due to the progress of global warming. 
Concurrently a compilation of all days since 1915 when temperatures exceeded 90F shows them decreasing with time rather than increasing in Figure 2.	The figure again has no source, no way to check how it was computed. Days over 90F focuses on maximum temperature and summer days, the data most affected by the Dust Bowl.
People who study the impacts of global warming have found that if ECS is low — say, less than two — then the impacts of global warming on the economy will be mostly small and, in many places, mildly beneficial. If it is very low, for instance around one, it means greenhouse gas emissions are simply not worth doing anything about.	This passage is misleading. It seems to imply that society has already decided to exactly double CO2 concentrations and has committed to emitting no further greenhouse gasses after that. If that were the case, then we could in fact assess climate change impacts in the manner done here. However, society is far from committing to stabilizing CO2 concentrations at “only” twice their preindustrial levels. We may go well beyond that. In that case, lower equilibrium climate sensitivity just means that it takes longer to reach a given level of warming. So even if climate sensitivity turns out to be very low, all the worst impacts could still be realized—they would just be delayed.
[headline:] Climate Change ‘Heat Records’ Are a Huge Data Manipulation	This is the biggest and most ludicrous claim of the article—the claim that will be read most and shared most on social media—and the article provides no evidence the data was manipulated.
“At a cost of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion annually, the Paris climate agreement, recently ratified by China, is likely to be history’s most expensive treaty. It will slow the world’s economic growth to force a shift to inefficient green energy sources.”	Not sure how these costs are derived—references would be good. […] These treaty costs may appear unprecedented, but so are the risks posed by climate change. Climate change “costs” are hard to quantify precisely – for instance, how to give a monetary value to the loss of certain ecosystems?—but likely to be quite significant. This recent study in Nature, for instance, indicates that: “If future adaptation mimics past adaptation, unmitigated warming is expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes roughly 23% by 2100 and widening global income inequality, relative to scenarios without climate change”. Burke et al (2015) Global non-linear effect of temperature on economic production. Nature 
Climate projections also assume […] that a temporary terrestrial vertebrate on an evolving planet can change major planetary and extraterrestrial systems.	This is the “argument from incredulity” logical fallacy. Ian Plimer is so bemused by the physics of climate change science, he refuses to accept its conclusions.
