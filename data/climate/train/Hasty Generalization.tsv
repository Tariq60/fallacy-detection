“In Albany, New York, the high temperature of 74 degrees on Thursday was the warmest temperature on record for any day during the months of December, January and February.”	Seasonal records like this are even more impressive and much more robust as they are composed of much larger sample sizes than the individual day’s values.	article50.txt
“It’s far too early to tell if what we are seeing in the Arctic, and now the Antarctic, is a sharp shift towards warmer poles with less ice. Scientists are quick to point out that weather in these regions can change quickly, but this is another expected result of climate change.”	Certainly the loss of sea ice is largely a result of warming from increased atmospheric concentrations of CO2. So it’s not surprising to see the changes in the Arctic. Climate models also predict that Antarctic sea ice will decline eventually, especially once the ozone hole recovers. There is some evidence* that the ozone hole has led to stronger circumpolar winds that spread the Antarctic sea ice cover out from the continent and since there is no land to bound the sea ice (like in the Arctic) it can expand towards the equator until it reaches warmer ocean temperatures.

“There is now less sea ice on Earth than at any time on record. Ice in the Arctic and Antarctic melted to record low levels in January, scientists reported this week.”	One has to bear in mind that the seasonal developments of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice are out of phase by ~6 months. Hence, the Earth’s “total” sea ice extent is a number with limited meaning, and is not directly obvious to interpret. In addition, this number smooths out regional variations, which can be particularly pronounced in the Antarctic. Nevertheless, just like global-mean temperature or the GDP of a country, this number can be useful to have a 0th-order view on the health and state of our planet.	article47.txt
A new report has warned there’s an existential risk to humanity from the climate crisis within the coming decades, and a ‘high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end’ over the next three decades unless urgent action is taken.	This is hyperbole. The scenario constructed in this report does not have a “high likelihood” of occurring in part because it requires a confluence of circumstances coming together. While it’s certainly true that climate change will be damaging to society and the environment and many of the consequences will be severe this does not equate to a high likelihood of civilisation coming to an end.
