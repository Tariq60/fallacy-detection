“The Alaskan tundra is warming so quickly it has become a net emitter of carbon dioxide ahead of schedule, a new study finds”	The study doesn’t really say that. The PNAS study itself focused on 3 years (2012-2014) for which aircraft measurements were taken from April to November, and finds that Alaskan tundra was a source of carbon for 2 of these 3 years (2012 is a small sink). Then these flux estimates are compared to  data from CMIP5 models for those particular years. However,  the PNAS paper does not assess when these CMIP5 models become sources of CO2. One would need to see long time series of the CMIP5 models, along with longer time series of aircraft measurements and inferred carbon fluxes to estimate when each turn from sink to sources.
“Severe ‘snowmageddon’ winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures, say researchers, with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked.”	“Strongly linked” is an overstatement here. There is some evidence, but I don’t think a majority of climate scientists would make claims as strong as these. 
A new report has warned there’s an existential risk to humanity from the climate crisis within the coming decades, and a ‘high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end’ over the next three decades unless urgent action is taken.	The “report” is not a peer-reviewed scientific paper. It’s from some sort of “think tank” who can basically write what they like. The report itself misunderstands / misrepresents science, and does not provide traceable links to the science it is based on so it cannot easily be checked (although someone familiar with the literature can work it out, and hence see where the report’s conclusions are ramped-up from the original research).
“It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.”	Virtually all statements in this article have been proven wrong so many times by scientific experts that it is unreasonable to once again show that they are wrong. But I want to focus on the statement “it has never been shown” only. How can one claim that the impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions has “never been shown that…”? Clearly, for this author, science per se either does not exist or else has no credibility whatsoever. Surely then, scientific research itself cannot exist, there is no geology to find coal resources, no studies “of natural processes such as ocean degassing”, etc. From this, one can only conclude that we actually cannot know anything—not even the things that this author believes to be true.
Yet other scientists claim this is a red herring because of the positive feedback loop created by water vapour.	This entire article is a mess of false equivalency. It is not a case of “some scientists say this, while others say this”. There is the scientific consensus (the so-called 97%) and then there are a few fringe scientists such as Willie Soon who have been comprehensively proven to produce poor work riddled with errors.1 Benestad et al (2015) Learning from mistakes in climate research, Theoretical and Applied Climatology 
This is a critical error. Getting the tropical climate right is essential to understanding climate worldwide.	This is only a critical error because they’re desperate to discredit the models. If the disagreement were in the polar regions, they’d be talking about how important it is to get the polar regions right. Obviously, you want to get everything right, but we live on the surface, so getting that right is the most important—and the models do that.
“The peer-reviewed study by two scientists and a veteran statistician looked at the global average temperature datasets[…]”	As far as I can tell the linked report is not accepted for any journal and thus peer-reviewed is willfully misleading at best.
The noted oceanographer Walter Munk referred to sea-level rise as an “enigma”	It is interesting that this opinion piece starts off with “Munk’s enigma”. This was introduced by famed oceanographer Walter Munk in a 2002 paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The enigma refers to a key discrepancy between the amount of sea-level rise believed to have occurred during the 20th century and the effects it should have produced on the planet — specifically, on the Earth’s rotation. So in addition to all the devastating and obvious effects sea-level rise will produce on the planet, such as flooding and erosion, sea-level rise also has the more subtle, but nonetheless mind-boggling ability to alter the way the Earth rotates on its axis. In a recent paper, Jerry Mitrovica and an interdisciplinary team of colleagues claim to have resolved the enigma. They reinforce the awe-inspiring power of climate change to produce global-scale effects, changing the planet’s very rotation. I don’t understand the relevance of citing Walter Munk to support Singer’s argument.
“[Sea ice] also helps regulate the planet’s temperature by influencing the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean. It can affect weather in the U.S.”	There is currently no consensus in the scientific community about the magnitude of Arctic-lower-latitudes teleconnections compared to other teleconnections (e.g. from the tropics). This statement has to be taken with caution.
The knock-on consequences affect national security, as the scale of the challenges involved, such as pandemic disease outbreaks, are overwhelming. Armed conflicts over resources may become a reality, and have the potential to escalate into nuclear war. In the worst case scenario, a scale of destruction the authors say is beyond their capacity to model, there is a ‘high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end’.	This is a highly questionable conclusion. The reference provided in the report is for the “Global Catastrophic Risks 2018” report from the “Global Challenges Foundation” and not peer-reviewed literature. (It is worth noting that this latter report also provides no peer-reviewed evidence to support this claim). Furthermore, if it is apparently beyond our capability to model these impacts, how can they assign a ‘high likelihood’ to this outcome? While it is true that warming of this magnitude would be catastrophic, making claims such as this without evidence serves only to undermine the trust the public will have in the science. Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center for Atmospheric Research: It seems that the eye-catching headline-level claims in the report stem almost entirely from these knock-on effects, which the authors themselves admit are “beyond their capacity to model.” Thus, from a scientific perspective, the purported “high likelihood of civilization coming to an end by 2050” is essentially personal speculation on the part of the report’s authors, rather than a clear conclusion drawn from rigorous assessment of the 
“enough credible projections have been done to put together a range of scenarios that researchers are confident about”	Many projections have been done, but they may very well underestimate the true expected range of scenarios.
a study that totally debunks the whole concept of man-made Global Warming,	This study does no such thing. This is factually inaccurate.
since 1979 to the most reliable observations — those made by satellites and weather balloons over the vast tropics. 	These are not the “most reliable” observations. They have the largest issues with lack of independent data to check against, and different groups come up with temperature trends that are far more different than the surface temperature records.
“ The discrepancy between model-predicted warming and (lower) real-world observations has inspired new respect for natural climate variability relative to greenhouse-gas forcing. ”	Robert Bradley Jr. probably makes the typical mistake of equating the spread of individual model simulations within the ensemble spread with the model uncertainty. If climate models are used for decadal climate prediction, like Robert Bradley Jr. does here, the uncertainty is twice as large as the model spread. (more details and explanations) Natural variability has been studied by science since the beginning. That El Niño fluctuations can give the appearance of a “hiatus” is something scientists have warned about since the likes of Robert Bradley Jr. have started their “hiatus” meme, ignoring all those warnings. Without any need for statistical expertise, this can be seen in the plot below from the Texas State Climatologist. Source
in 1995 one scientist at the IPCC – Jonathan Overpeck – wrote an email to a colleague claiming ‘we have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.’	I challenge the author to find a source for this smear that satisfies journalistic standards.
“The list of variables that shape climate […] would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision.”	The basic argument in the remainder of the article is one of “complexity” and the notion that climatologists cannot perfectly understand thousands of variables, and hence the behavior of the system under investigation. Jacoby is not completely wrong—climate is extremely complex, and poses no shortage of interesting research questions. However, it is sometimes difficult for non-specialists to appreciate the emergent simplicity that can arise in an incredibly complex system. After all, how do we know summer will be warmer than winter, that the top of Mt. Everest is colder than the base, or that Arizona is expected to be on average drier than Florida, or that the equator ought to be hotter than New York, or that the climate will cool following a large volcanic eruption? These statements are not just based on prior observations, but in fact can be predicted by applying fundamental equations to a rotating planet. Part of the beauty in studying atmospheric science is in gaining an appreciation for where complexity is counterbalanced by an almost eerie predictability, much like how the outcome of a single spin in roulette is hopelessly unpredictable (and certainly influenced by every slight detail at the time the dealer releases the ball), but casinos have no problem with such complexity because the statistical behavior of the roulette wheel is well-posed. Similarly, the statistical behavior of the atmosphere, while unsolved, is not actually that complex. The appeal to complexity is a compelling one. Nonetheless, progress has been made in many complex sciences (astrophysics, geology) in which the system under investigation cannot be experimentally isolated, and yet where so much is known. However, it turns out to be incredibly simple to rule out El Niño, volcanic eruptions, soil quality, sunspot cycles, plate tectonics, etc. to the trend in global temperatures since 1950. Just as geologists can inform you of the glacial history of a region, sometimes with little more than a trained eye, CO2 leaves behind “fingerprints” in the atmospheric warming that other “forcing agents” do not. Another perhaps surprising component is that this result is not extremely sensitive to unknown variables. Suppose, for example, that the Andes Mountains were abruptly flattened. This would almost certainly affect important aspects of the global and regional climate, but many of the critical phenomena of the climate system (e.g. that the equator is wet where air rises, that storm tracks develop in the mid-latitudes, the presence of a jet stream, etc.) would still remain. Furthermore, adding CO2 to a “flat-Andes hypothetical Earth” would still result in warming. It’s physics, and it’s unavoidable. It is true that the exact magnitude of future warming, even if we knew future carbon emissions perfectly, is still not known to within even 10%. However, that uncertainty range does not overlap with “very little warming” or “make the planet uninhabitable warming.” In any case, if one’s argument is based on how complex the system is, surely perturbing that complex system is not something they ought to advocate for!
“Here’s an unusual one from Guillet et al suggesting that there’s nothing new about wildly early or late grape harvests through the centuries	The Guillet et al paper primarily uses wine grapes to look at the impact of the 1257 Samalas eruption (volcanic aerosols cool the climate, delaying grape maturation and harvest). I haven’t read the paper in the detail, but as far as I can tell they do not make any claims about recent warming or harvest trends. Contrary to the claim quoted above, our own work suggest that warming has significantly advanced wine grape harvests over western Europe1. We found, on average, that winegrape harvests have been occurring significantly earlier since 1980 (on average 10 days earlier than the 1600-1900 average). In fact, 2003 was the earliest harvest in the record by about a month. On a broader note, I want to point out that exceptional events in the paleoclimate record do not undermine the case for attributing recent warming to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. We know there have been warm periods in the past, but we have quite a bit of significant independent evidence that recent warming can only be explained by invoking anthropogenic activities. [read the Dr Guillet’s comment below] 1- Cook & Wolkovich (2016) Climate change decouples drought from early wine grape harvests in France. Nature 
“Ocean acidification is the terrifying threat whereby all that man-made CO2 we’ve been pumping into the atmosphere may react with the sea to form a sort of giant acid bath.”	That is incorrect. No peer-reviewed article claim that the ocean will become acid (pH < 7).
since 1979 to the most reliable observations — those made by satellites and weather balloons over the vast tropics. 	These are hardly the most reliable measurements. For a description of the tortured history of the satellite measurements, see page 8 of this document. In fact, the surface temperature record is much more reliable and the models agree well with it. It’s as likely that unresolved errors in the satellite record are responsible for the errors as problems in the models.
“While the notion that the impact on earth’s orbital cycle on solar radiation levels is the most significant factor determining global temperatures is anything but new, the team of scientists seem to have tied the phenomenon to planetary orbits in a more concrete manner than previous studies.”	I can’t help but think this sentence really refers to a research article called “A simple rule to determine which insolation cycles lead to interglacials” by Tzedakis and colleagues, rather than “Theory of chaotic orbital variations confirmed by Cretaceous geological evidence” by Ma, Meyers & Sageman.
“Several of the papers note that the primary influence on warming appears to be solar activity. Few, if any, entertain the notion that carbon dioxide levels have much to do with it.”	Many of these papers discuss the causes of temperature changes over the past several centuries or millennia. Indeed, solar activity is thought to be one of the primary drivers of the observed temperature variability over this these longer time periods. This is not the case over the past several decades. Over this recent time period we know that the Sun’s intensity has not gotten stronger because we are measuring it with satellites and we know that increasing greenhouse gasses are causing warming. We know that increasing greenhouse gasses are causing warming due to fundamental physical laws—not simply from observing that temperatures and greenhouse gas levels happen to be rising at the same time.
“The Lancet researchers found that about 0.5%—half a percent—of all deaths are associated with heat, not only from acute problems like heat stroke, but also increased mortality from cardiac events and dehydration. But more than 7% of deaths are related to cold—counting hypothermia, as well as increased blood pressure and risk of heart attack that results when the body restricts blood flow in response to frigid temperatures.”	I do not want to question the quality of this particular study, but it’s worth looking at how they get such numbers. First, this is a statistical study where they look at data on numbers of deaths and temperatures in various locations: of course, nothing says if, or how, these deaths are really related to temperature (heat or cold). This is an empirical study. Lomborg’s comments suggest that the authors of this study are counting deaths explicitly caused by heat or cold, but this is not the case. Second, they basically fit a temperature-death risk response curve to this data. They then see for what temperature the mortality risk is lowest – and then they aggregate all the deaths below (for cold-related deaths) and above (for heat-related ones) that temperature. Because the temperature of minimum mortality is often high (around 20-25C, or lower 70’s F), for cold-related deaths this leads to integrating the response function (even with low death risks) over much of the temperature distribution. See plots below. The authors indicate as much: “This difference was mainly caused by the high minimum-mortality percentile, with most of the mean daily temperatures being lower than the optimum value.” This methodology also explains why most cold-related deaths appear due to “moderate cold”. This is worth explaining, because I am not sure dying in 15C weather (60F) in Rome or Sydney is really what people will understand when they read about “cold-related deaths”! From Gasparrini et al. figure 1: Exposure–response associations as best linear unbiased prediction (with 95% empirical CI, shaded grey) in representative cities of the 13 countries, with related temperature distributions. Solid grey lines are minimum mortality temperatures and dashed grey lines are the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. RR=relative risk. The other thing that is easy to see is that the risk curve generally increases slowly towards cold temperature, but a lot more steeply past high temperatures. So even if one agrees with how this study classifies and counts “cold deaths”, the fact that they outnumber heat deaths, in absolute numbers, does not necessarily mean that increasing temperatures will reduce deaths: based on these plots, it could well be that warming will reduce cold-related deaths less than it increases heat-related ones. And indeed, this is what the studies about future projection of temperature-related deaths that they cite, and that Lomborg discusses, do find. 
“Some experts, such as UN climate scientist Dr. Indur Goklany, have defended rising CO2 levels as a good thing for humanity. Goklany has argued that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere ‘is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally.”	Technically, there is no such thing, really, as a UN climate scientist. There are climate scientists, worldwide, working for universities or national research organizations, and who contribute to the UN’s IPCC review process when it produces its report, every 7 years or so. Dr. Goklany is listed (Wikipedia) as working for the US Department of Interior as a science and technology policy analyst. His PhD is in electrical engineering, and beyond opinion pieces, he doesn’t seem to have published in the field of climate sciences. So I am not sure why his opinion is relevant at all—it goes without saying that it goes against the assessment of most of the scientific community working on climate change issues.
“The peer-reviewed study by two scientists and a veteran statistician looked at the global average temperature datasets[…]”	In addition to not being peer reviewed, the study also doesn’t appear to cite ANY peer-reviewed literature to support its conclusions, nor does the report provide any additional references. Furthermore, the report appears to have a clear dismissive tone towards peer-reviewed research and uses dubious language such as “Climate Alarmist”, further straining the credibility of the report this article is based solely on.
“But observations, such as those on our CO2 Coalition website, show that increased CO2 levels over the next century will cause modest and beneficial warming—perhaps as much as one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit)”	That [1 °C warming] is an absolute best-case scenario, if significant mitigation action is taken urgently. Increased CO2 leads to warming, which leads to increased atmospheric water vapor, less ice, and other feedbacks. A doubling of CO2 concentrations would lead to about 3 °C warming. Timothy Osborn, Professor, University of East Anglia, and Director of Research, Climatic Research Unit: Projections of future warming can’t be made from observations alone: we need understanding of the mechanisms and physical processes. Neither of these are provided by the quoted website, which instead contains inaccurate articles about supposed adjustments to temperature data and claiming a new ‘little ice age’ is already here—both of which have been shown to be incorrect by scientific research. (For example, section 1.3.2 of the Fourth Assessment Working Group I IPCC report compared global temperature records from various vintages and found broad consistency.)
Their analysis calculates the existential climate-related security risk to Earth through a scenario set 30 years into the future.	No, the report’s authors have merely read (or possibly seen without actually reading) a few of the scariest papers they could find, misunderstood (or not read properly) at least one of them, and presented unjustified statements.
“new research in Nature Climate Change not only reinforces the reality of this trend — which is already provoking debate about the overall climate consequences of a warming Arctic — but statistically attributes it to human causes, which largely means greenhouse gas emissions (albeit with a mix of other elements as well).”	That’s a good summary of what’s new in this study: Arctic greening had been documented before, its causes had been discussed, but this is the first study to formally attribute this greening trend to human gas emissions. Note that trends in surface temperature and in some aspects of the hydrological cycle (e.g., precipitation, evaporation) have been detected and attributed similarly; this is the first study to do so with vegetation trends (which appear closely related to temperature trends, though).
But the thermometer records showed that the warming stopped from 2000 to 2014. Until they didn’t. In two of the four global surface series, data were adjusted in two ways that wiped out the “pause” that had been observed[…]	This section completely misrepresents the efforts to produce a global-average temperature data set. There are 4 scientific groups producing 4 independent records. They all agree and most of them post their code, so you can see exactly how they do the calculation—there’s certainly nothing nefarious going on. There are adjustments to correct for known issues in the data, but they don’t have much of an effect on the global average temperature record. The warming of the surface record is supported by many independent data: loss of ice all over the globe, warming of the ocean, sea level rise, and, yes, there’s reasonable agreement between the satellite and surface temperature records (see Table 2.3 of the 2018 State of the Climate report1). 1- State of the Climate in 2018, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society
Yet, some scientists argue that the gas is not capable of producing the extreme temperature rises seen in recent decades.	In the same way some “scientists” claim quantum mechanics is wrong. Single scientists are not a source of reliable scientific information, especially after searching them out for holding views that reject the scientific understanding of the world. Normally the reporting in the science section of a reputable newspaper would be based on the overwhelming evidence presented in high quality peer reviewed scientific journals.
“According to a recent National Economic Research Associates Economic Consulting study, the Paris Agreement could obliterate $3 trillion of GDP, 6.5 million industrial sector jobs and $7,000 in per capita household income from the American economy by 2040. Meeting the 2025 emissions reduction target alone could subtract $250 billion from our GDP and eliminate 2.7 million jobs. The cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining industries could see their production cut by 21% 19%, and 11% respectively.”	The National Economic Research Associates study assumes that the United States meets the 2025 target for reducing annual emissions of greenhouse gases, which is set out in its “nationally determined contribution”, and goes on to reduce its annual emissions by 80% by 2050 compared with 1990. The authors of the study admit on pages 10-11 to making the astonishing assumption that every other country in the world ignores the targets in their nationally determined contributions and make no further efforts to reduce emissions, so that much of the calculated costs to the United States economy subsequently arise from high-carbon companies relocate or lose business to competitors in other countries. The model assumes no increase in low-carbon electricity generation over the next four decades compared with the baseline scenario, so no increase in economic growth or jobs in the low-carbon sector and no substitution of low-carbon energy for high-carbon energy—emissions reductions are achieved by imposing very high carbon prices that reduce the consumption of coal and energy. The study makes the unrealistic assumption that there will be no economic benefits to the United States from avoided impacts of climate change or co-benefits from reducing local air pollution from fossil fuels which currently contributes to the premature deaths of 200,000 Americans each year, according to a study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology*. Overall, this is an inaccurate and misleading assessment of the cost to the United States of participating in the Paris Agreement and honouring the commitments in its nationally determined contribution—indeed, the extreme assumptions mean this a study of the costs of policy-makers attempting to achieve emissions reduction targets in some of the least cost-effective ways available.

“The peer-reviewed study by two scientists and a veteran statistician looked at the global average temperature datasets[…]”	If this author knew anything about the process of scientific research and publication, he would realize just how ridiculous this statement is. Note that the study reported in this article has not been published in any reputable peer-reviewed journal, undoubtedly because it would never pass muster.
“As it happens, Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying effect — disease mutation. One reason you hadn’t heard about Zika until recently is that it had been trapped in Uganda; another is that it did not, until recently, appear to cause birth defects.”	It would be helpful to know the source of the statements about Zika. Zika was first recognized in Uganda, but has not been trapped there. Zika has been moving around the world for the past few years, presumably associated with trade and travel. With limited surveillance of Zika and with limited numbers of cases, it isn’t possible to say whether the disease caused birth defects before the large outbreak last year; research is underway to determine that.
