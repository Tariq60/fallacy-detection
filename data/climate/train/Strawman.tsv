“There was, he said, an ‘inherent bias’ in scientific journals which predisposed them to publish ‘doom and gloom stories’.”	The words “inherent bias” do not appear in my article. Rather, I refer to “publication bias”. In research, an “inherent bias” is one which is inextricably tied to the core nature of the phenomenon being studied and cannot, therefore, be eliminated by increasing the sample size or choosing a different estimator. “Publication bias”, on the other hand, refers to the general (across all of science) phenomenon by which studies presenting positive results – supporting the hypothesis being tested – are more likely to be published than those reporting negative results. This sometimes creates a situation where published studies may be systematically different from unpublished studies – for example, studies showing an impact of ocean acidification might be published more easily and in higher profile journals than studies showing no impact. However, I only allude to this possibility in the introduction; I do not asses it quantitatively (something that would, in fact, be very difficult to do). Finally, the words “doom and gloom” do not appear in my introduction.	article45.txt
With that in mind, they propose a plausible and terrifying “2050 scenario” whereby humanity could face irreversible collapse in just three decades.	Not to downplay the seriousness of what humanity is facing, but the report in fact doesn’t make this claim. While scientists do expect many of the changes to the Earth system due to global heating to be “irreversible,” and while this should be extremely concerning to any reasonable person, it is different than “irreversible human collapse” which, if you think about it, needs unpacking.	
“Higher temperatures, we’re told, will be deadly—killing “thousands to tens of thousands” of Americans”	Whether this is on purpose or not, Mr. Lomborg’s immediate focus on the part of the report dealing with temperature-related deaths makes it sound as if this is the only focus of the report. However, the report also deals with air quality impacts, food safety, extreme events, etc.	
“The good news, scientists said, was that central and southern sections of the reef fared far better, with “only” 6% and 1% of the coral dead, respectively.”	The pattern of warming this year resulted in the highest thermal stress being located in the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef. This can be seen in the coral bleaching products from NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch. Source: NOAA Coral Reef Watch 	
“This will achieve almost nothing. My peer-reviewed research, published last November in the journal Global Policy, shows that even if every nation were to fulfill all their carbon-cutting promises by 2030 and stick to them all the way through the century—at a cost of more than $100 trillion in lost GDP—global temperature rise would be reduced by a tiny 0.3°F (0.17°C).” 	Dr. Lomborg sets out to show that the INDCs [emission reduction pledges] are useless. To do so he grossly misrepresents the pledges. He constructs an incomplete accounting that omits the pledges of many nations, ignores China’s pledge to cap its emissions by 2030, and assumes that the [European Union countries] will abandon their commitment to emissions reductions as soon as their pledges are fulfilled. (find more details in this rebuttal of Lomborg’s paper) 	
The first adjustment changed how the temperature of the ocean surface is calculated, by replacing satellite data with drifting buoys and temperatures in ships’ water intake.	This isn’t what happened. Satellite data was not replaced, it was never there in the first place. Independent satellite data confirmed that the new corrections are solid.1 1- Hausfather et al (2017) Assessing recent warming using instrumentally homogeneous sea surface temperature records, Science Advances 	article130.txt
the data does not support the claim that the United States is hotter than ever as a result of rising Carbon dioxide levels	This would be claim about the average temperature of America and would normally refer to the annual average temperature—that does not follow from summer maximum temperature records.	article124.txt
“Scientists were caught off guard when the true ice conditions were different from their predictions, which took place only months ago…”	The linked article is not about predictions made for Arctic sea ice.	article88.txt
Fifty-five percent of the global population are subject to more than 20 days a year of lethal heat conditions beyond that which humans can survive	This is clearly from Mora et al (2017) although the report does not include a citation of the paper as the source of that statement. The way it is written here (and in the report) is misleading because it gives the impression that everyone dies in those conditions. That is not actually how Mora et al define “deadly heat” – they merely looked for heatwaves when somebody died (not everybody) and then used that as the definition of a “deadly” heatwave.	article127.txt
“At the end of the current paper, the researchers are blunt about the consequences of a continuing loss of oceanic oxygen. ‘Far-reaching implications for marine ecosystems and fisheries can be expected,’ they write.”	It’s true that this is the last sentence of the paper. However, they refer to another study here: Cheung et al (2012) Shrinking of fishes exacerbates impacts of global ocean changes on marine ecosystems. Nature Climate Change. 	
They failed to predict a decadelong [sic] pause in global temperatures.”	Individual runs of individual models did capture such behaviour as has been shown by a wealth of literature on the topic. On a decadal scale, natural variability plays an important role, as can short-lived forcing effects. The scientific community has a substantial understanding of the “pause” and its causes. This understanding builds rather than diminishes confidence in the climate models.	
“the climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming ‘hiatus’”	Except that the report (the paper published in Nature Geoscience) never said that. The paper does not describe modelled warming vs. observations over the “hiatus” period.	
“Yet, a new study of 60 climate models and scenarios shows this warning fails to take into account the fact that global warming will mean precipitation increases. Indeed, water flow will actually increase over this century, which is likely beneficial in increasing “water availability in the Indus Basin irrigation scheme during the spring growing seasons.” ”	The cited study states that runoff in the Indus basin will increase during the first half of the 21st century, mainly due to increasing glacier melt (not precipitation increase as mentioned here). This increase in flow from glacier melt is projected to decrease during the 2nd half of the 21st century (Immerzeel et al, 2013: Rising river flows throughout the twenty-first century in two Himalayan glacierized watersheds). … Besides, an increase in frequency and magnitude of hydrological extremes (flooding events) is projected.

the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed	The op-ed authors reference the 2017 State of the Climate Report. I helped prepare the “Lower and Mid-Tropospheric Temperature” section and it is unclear where the authors’ statistic comes from (“seven times as much warming…”). The average CMIP5 model warming in the tropical troposphere does outpace observations (by a factor of 1.5 – 3.3, depending on dataset). This issue deserves (and has received) scrutiny.1,2,3,4,5,6 The difference in warming rates between observations and models largely arises in the early 2000s. A number of assessments have concluded that this slowdown in warming in the 2000s is in part due to natural variability (the Earth’s warming was slowed due to climate variability) and forcing (the real world experienced different solar and volcanic aerosol forcing than what was used in the models). Models do simulate natural “hiatus” periods like that experienced in the early 2000s, but, since they are random, they generally do not occur at the same times as in the real world (though some models happened to have a slowdown in warming in the early 2000s). Furthermore, forcing agents (greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar changes) are prescribed to models. Since we do not know the exact evolution of forcing agents for future projections, they are estimated. In this case, the estimated forcing was different than what occurred in the real world. When these issues are taken into account, models and observations are in agreement. Over long periods, when natural variability is a smaller issue, models and observations agree on the rate of warming. Assessments of model projections of climate change show that models have typically been quite skillful (e.g. here). 1- IPCC (2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis (Ch. 9, Box 9.2) 2- Meehl et al (2014) Climate model simulations of the observed early-2000s hiatus of global warming, Nature Climate Change 3- Gleisner et al (2015) Recent global warming hiatus dominated by low‐latitude temperature trends in surface and troposphere data, Geophysical Research Letters 4- Medhaug et al (2017) Reconciling controversies about the ‘global warming hiatus’, Nature 5- Santer et al (2017) Comparing Tropospheric Warming in Climate Models and Satellite Data, Journal of Climate 6- Santer et al (2017b) Causes of differences in model and satellite tropospheric warming 	article130.txt
Longer term, if emissions rise unchecked, scientists fear climate effects so severe that they might destabilize governments, produce waves of refugees, precipitate the sixth mass extinction of plants and animals in the Earth’s history, and melt the polar ice caps, causing the seas to rise high enough to flood most of the world’s coastal cities. The emissions that create those risks are happening now, raising deep moral questions for our generation.”	This paragraph suggests that the emissions that will precipitate the sixth mass extinction are happening now, which I think is misleading. We can stop those impacts by reducing our emissions.	article77.txt
“the rapid ice loss recorded by satellite measurements over the last 20 years is not likely to be a blip, but part of a long-term trend being exacerbated by climate change. Global warming is driving major melting on the surface of Greenland’s glaciers and is speeding up their travel into the sea.”	While this paragraph is not imprecise, there is a slight wiggle room for the wrong interpretation that the acceleration of ice loss seen in the past decades is just a “blip” on top of a much larger rate of mass loss since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This new work finds the contribution to sea level rise from the Greenland Ice Sheet since the LGM to be 4.6 ± 0.7 m – an average ice loss rate of roughly 75-80 Gt/yr, which is almost identical to the rate of ice loss in the 20th century (75 Gt/yr) suggested by Kjeldsen et al. (2015). The rate of ice loss has accelerated in the past decades so that we today see rates that are more than the triple of those earlier rates. However, I do not think this is a major issue, as the paragraph is sandwiched in between precise explanations and context provided by scientists. 	article35.txt
“in a letter to The Times from Lord Krebs and company, essentially telling the newspaper to stop reporting less-than-negative climate stories.”	This is a misrepresentation of the Lords’ letter. The letter builds on scientists’ analyses of two inaccurate articles on climate change in The Times, and it asks the editor to center their coverage on the facts rather than on the viewpoints of a marginal pressure group. Misrepresenting someone’s position to make it easier to attack is known as a straw man fallacy. 	article27.txt
it was assumed carbon dioxide had the pivotal role in driving climate change and that the effects of clouds, back-radiation and the sun were trivial.	It was not assumed carbon dioxide had a pivotal role, this is calculated using equations based on physics. The effect of clouds… was not assumed, but is a result of equations you get from physics. Here is a 1989 study* that talks about how important clouds are. “Back radiation” is included in all climate models and comes from carbon dioxide, among other gases. The Sun’s activity is included in climate models, although it has been generally cooling if anything over the last 40+ years.

“climate change skeptics and contrarians … have long contended that global warming won’t be all bad, and that plants might help offset any global warming trend.”	It is not only a skeptic’s argument: the land biosphere does offset part of the warming by taking up 25% of emissions. However, the uncertainty in the durability of this pattern is very large with no clear consensus between earth system models used in the IPCC latest assessment report, see Figure below: From Friedlingstein et al (2014) Uncertainties in CMIP5 Climate Projections due to Carbon Cycle Feedbacks, Journal of Climate	
“More than half of the 44 studies selected for publication found that raised levels of CO2 had little or no impact on marine life, including crabs, limpets, sea urchins and sponges” 	It is crucial to understand exactly which species are and aren’t affected by Ocean Acidification, as that will determine how ecosystems will change through time. I will also point out that if this figure is correct, and 50% of organisms are unaffected by Ocean Acidification, 50% of organisms are affected by Ocean Acidification, which is a HUGE amount of marine life. It also neglects the fact that reefs themselves are most definitely affected, which creates and maintains the habitat for many of these other organisms in the first place.	
“But other scientific authors have expressed considerable skepticism of these kinds of ideas in the past. A recent study in Nature Geoscience, for instance, called into question whether the Arctic’s melting, and in particular its sea ice loss, has been causing winter cooling over Eurasia, another idea that has been swept up in the debate over the jet stream and weather extremes.”	Again, the debate has been about Arctic amplification and winter storm behavior, so this is somewhat misleading. It gives the impression that the new study tacitly pushes the debate about the winter storms toward the Francis/Vavrus side.	article55.txt
“The methodology used by the studies was often flawed”	My introduction does not present a quantitative assessment of the frequency of occurrence of methodological flaws in the ocean acidification literature.	article45.txt
Because it’s getting warmer, there’s more CO2 coming out which means it’s going to get warmer which means there’s more CO2 coming out[…] And it will just run away with itself.”	(Dr Commane is the first author of the scientific study discussed in the ThinkProgress article) I spoke with Henry Fountain (New York Times), Chris Mooney (Washington Post), Oli Milman (Guardian), and Bob Berwyn (Inside Climate News) about the PNAS paper and I think they all did a great job condensing my attempts at communicating the message of the paper. The radio chat I did with a local NPR station in Juneau, AK (which I think is the source of this article) was probably the least comprehensive attempt—I tried to make things as simple as possible and didn’t realize that the quote would sound so off when taken outside of that context. I think the written articles better conveyed the essence of the paper compared to what I tried to say in the radio piece.
