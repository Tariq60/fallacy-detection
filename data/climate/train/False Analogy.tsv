“Consider where they move. Migration patterns show people heading for warm states like Texas and Florida, not snowy Minnesota and Michigan.”	This focuses on average climate rather than on extremes, and such patterns of migration are based on our knowledge of the past. As the frequency of extreme hot days increases, as the number of extreme hurricanes increases, and as sea levels rise, people may find that Florida is not so attractive after all.
” ‘You’ve only got to look at Singapore. It’s two-and-a-half times higher than the worst-case scenario for climate change, and it’s one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in.’ ”	I am not sure I understand Lovelock’s point about Singapore. Singapore is a relatively wealthy, urbanized country, with an economy that is not highly weather dependent. One would expect Singapore to be able to adapt to temperature changes with far greater ease than would a poor agrarian economy. Also, several studies have projected massive increases in sea-level as a consequence of climate change. Most of Singapore is within 15 meters of sea-level. Thus, if CO2 emissions continue, we can expect most of Singapore to be underwater within a few centuries.
Globally averaged thermometers show two periods of warming since 1900: a half-degree from natural causes in the first half of the 20th century, before there was an increase in industrial carbon dioxide that was enough to produce it, and another half-degree in the last quarter of the century.	The earlier warming (~0.3-0.4 °C) is about a third to a half of the warming since the 1970s (0.8-0.9 °C). They are not comparable, and selecting “the last quarter” of the 20th century to ignore the warming since 2000 misleads readers. Secondly, human activity was sufficient to cause warming in the first half of the 20th century.
“Therefore, scientists now have observed evidence validating climate model projections”	I think this is a strong statement. The authors are not validating model predictions against observations—they are comparing model predictions to an extrapolation obtained from 25 years of data.
“Venus, which was once a very Earth-like planet with plenty of life-supporting water before runaway climate change rapidly transformed it into an arid and uninhabitable sphere enveloped in an unbreathable gas”	There’s been a lot written about this recently, following the BBC’s publicising of Stephen Hawking’s remarks on it.  I don’t think it is accurate to say that Venus was “once a very Earth-like planet” and hence imply that the runaway greenhouse effect could happen here. For one thing, Venus is much closer to the sun. A runaway greenhouse effect on Earth is not thought to be a plausible threat.
“But scientific research indicates the world was last this warm about 115,000 years ago and that the planet has not experienced such high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for 4m years.”	At the last interglacial period 115,000 years ago, increased solar intensity was responsible for the added warmth, but today’s high CO2 was last seen in the atmosphere 3-5 million years ago. At that time, global mean temperatures were a couple of degrees higher than present, and sea levels were several metres higher than present.
“While scientists are loathe to attribute any single event to changes in the climate, they state that warming temperatures are helping tip the scales towards altered precipitation. Some, however, bristle at the belief that because floods and storms have always occurred, they should not be linked to climate change”	It is true that floods and storms always have occurred, but they have always ocurred for a physical reason. This may be evidence suggesting that these phenomena are rather sensitive to a climate change, if modest natural changes in physical conditions already give rise to variations in the floods and storm activity. We now know that the earth’s atmosphere is changing (increased CO2 and a global warming). It would be naive to think that floods and storms do not change when important factors change while they have always changed in the past. It is also important to think about these concepts in a risk-analysis frame, and it is important to plan for various plausible scenarios.
“they do know that in acid waters, oysters and mussels will struggle to grow their shells, and that when the pH of human blood drops as much as the oceans’ pH has over the past generation, it induces seizures, comas, and sudden death.”	Human blood chemistry is regulated in a way the sea water is not, so this statement is only marginally relevant. 
“Earth’s climate system is unfathomably complex. […] The more variables there are in any system or train of events, the lower the probability of all of them coming to pass. Your odds of correctly guessing the outcome of a flipped coin are 1 in 2, but your odds of guessing correctly twice in a row are only 1 in 4 — i.e., ½ x ½ Extending your winning streak to a third guess is even less probable: just 1 in 8.”	Yes, it is complex, but not unfathomable. The basics are simple—the energy budget at Earth’s surface is controlled by the intensity of sunlight reaching the ground and the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. That’s it. This analogy implies everything is happening randomly in the climate system. This is not the case. There is a great deal of structure imposed by the laws of fluid motion and energy transfer, and by the basic geometry and rotation rate of the Earth. 
“The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions.”	While this picture might provide a leading order approximation, it is mostly valid over the oceans. Over land, recent research has shown that the “wet get wetter, dry get drier” picture does not really apply and things are a little more complex (e.g., see: Byrne and O’Gorman. “The Response of Precipitation Minus Evapotranspiration to Climate Warming: Why the “Wet-Get-Wetter, Dry-Get-Drier” Scaling Does Not Hold over Land” Journal of Climate (2015).)
“In those years, the jet stream deviated deeply southwards over those regions, pulling down savagely cold air. Prof Adam Scaife, a climate modelling expert at the UK’s Met Office, said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good: ‘The consensus points towards that being a real effect.’”	This refers to a southward shifted jet in response to sea ice loss (a negative North Atlantic Oscillation pattern). It’s not clear at all that this is the same kind of behaviour as suggested by the quoted scientists. 
The data showed European average ​temperatures were more than 2C above normal and temperatures were 6-10C above normal over most of France, Germany and northern Spain during the final days of the month, according to C3S.	It is not a good idea to combine numbers for the full month and all of Europe with numbers for a few days and a part of Europe. That double difference makes it hard to understand and easy to miss one of the differences when casually reading it. 6-10 degrees Celsius for the entire month would have been special, but for a few days it is not.
Renew­ables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape.	There is no comparison here with the alternatives. For example, the claimed wind turbine health damages, for which the author shows evidence of zero deaths, should be compared with the millions of deaths that the World Health Organisation links to pollution every year, much of which is from fossil fuels.
“Through decades of research, it has become clear that human civilization, roughly 6,000 years old, developed during an unusually stable period for global sea levels.”	The last 6,000 years have been unusually stable for the period of time that we are able to constrain rates of sea-level change particularly well (at sub-millennial timescales): see, for example, Lambeck et al (2014) Sea level and global ice volumes from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene.
“this event poses severe risks to health — particularly for children and the elderly […] an extreme 2003 heat wave that affected Paris and Europe, and which has indeed been connected to climate change through statistical attribution analysis […] killed hundreds of people in Paris and London, and a recent study attributed at least some of those deaths, themselves, to climate change.”	When the 2003 European heatwave occurred it killed 70 000 people. At the time the likelihood of that event occurring had doubled due to human influence. Now an event like this is 10 times more likely due to human influence.

“Healthy societies do not fall apart over slow, widely predicted, relatively small economic adjustments of the sort painted by climate analysis. Societies do fall apart from war, disease or chaos. Climate policy must compete with other long-term threats for always-scarce resources.”	To suggest that climate change does not bear (or has little bearing) upon war, disease, and chaos represents either an exceedingly narrow and optimistic view of available peer reviewed research on the influence of climate change on these outcomes or ignorance. The extraordinary threat that climate change already poses to national security was outlined by the U.S. Defense Department in 2015. Research on climate change and infectious disease risks suggests that it either directly (through changes in mosquito population distributions) or indirectly (through forcing mass migrations) will augment risks of pandemics.
“Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.”	The effects of CO2 do not decrease sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. The radiative effects of CO2 are logarithmic, so they increase slightly less the higher CO2 gets but they don’t decrease sharply.
