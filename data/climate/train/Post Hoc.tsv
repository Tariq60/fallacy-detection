“Hard evidence, including studies that use radioactivity to distinguish industrial emissions from natural emissions, shows that the extra gas is coming from human activity.”	Also important is that we have good estimates of how much fossil fuel we have burned, from which one can estimate the CO2 emissions. The increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is about half of those emissions (the rest was taken up by the vegetation and the oceans). It would have been more accurate to say that we can see that the CO2 increase is from burning fossil fuels by measuring isotopes (differences in the number of nuclear particles of atoms). Not all relevant isotopes are radioactive and the ones that are only a little.	article77.txt
Currently, sea-level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature, and certainly not on CO2. 	There is a clear relationship between the accelerating rate of sea-level rise and the increasing global temperature, which is shown in this post (e.g. in Figure 3).	article99.txt
“cold kills many more people than heat.”	Mr. Lomborg is confusing seasonal mortality with temperature-related mortality. It is true that mortality is higher during winter than summer. However, it does not follow that winter mortality is temperature-dependent (which summer mortality is). Dave Mills and I reviewed the evidence and concluded that only a small proportion of winter mortality is likely associated with temperature. A growing numbers of publications are exploring associations between weather and winter mortality, with differences in methods and results. The country with the strongest association between winter mortality and temperature is England, which appears in other publications to be at least partly due to cold housing. Winter mortality is lower in northern European countries.	article25.txt
“Professor Judith Curry, of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and president of the Climate Forecast Applications Network, said yesterday: ‘I disagree with Gavin. The record warm years of 2015 and 2016 were primarily caused by the super El Nino.’”	It seems kind of pointless to try to precisely attribute why one year was warmer or cooler than the last; this is basically just due to climate variability (including but not limited to El Niño). The broader point is that all evidence suggests that the long-term global surface warming trend has continued. There is no evidence that the rate of warming since 1998 is statistically different from the long-term trend since 1950.	article43.txt
“Scientists have published strong evidence that the warming climate is making heat waves more frequent and intense. It is also causing heavier rainstorms”	It is hard to attribute each particular event to human-induced climate change. The article correctly frames the influence in terms of increasing frequency and intensity of extremes, and directs the reader to a good reference page with clear explanations for non-experts. Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center for Atmospheric Research: Indeed, there is now observational evidence that global warming has already increased the likelihood and magnitude of extreme heat and intense downpours across much of the globe*.

“At the bottom of the world, sea ice is also at all-time record low levels around Antarctica, the data center said. The lack of ice in the Antarctic, where it is currently summer, is most pronounced in the Amundsen Sea, where only a few scattered patches of ice remain.”	Looking at recent time-evolution of Antarctic sea ice anomalies since November 2016 is insightful to appreciate the complexity of Antarctic sea ice dynamics. In early austral spring (below) the total Antarctic sea ice extent was already anomalously low because of strong ice retreat in the Indian Sector. 	article47.txt
“Ice core drilling shows that 800 years after natural warming, the atmosphere increases in carbon dioxide”	Recent work* shows that the temperature and CO2 rise were synchronous within uncertainties: if there was a lag it was less than 400 years, not 800 years as previously thought. Additionally, the temperature increase over the deglaciation cannot be explained solely by orbitally driven insolation changes (modifications of solar energy received by the Earth due to its position). The radiative effect of the CO2 rise amplifies the warming and explains part of the total deglacial warming.

“record temperatures brought in 2016 by an exceptionally strong El Niño”	Last year the annual global temperature was about 1.1 °C above a late-19th century baseline but only about 0.1°C of this was due to the El Niño—the other 1 °C is due to human influences. So while the record occurred in 2016 due to El Niño, most of the anomaly was due to climate change.	article60.txt
“In fact, all but the one [extinction event] that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas. The most notorious was 252 million years ago; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees, accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic, and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead.”	Other agents of destruction have been invoked for the end Permian extinction, involving toxic fluorine fumes from volcanic emissions or sulfides from the deep sea.
