“Because the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet could raise the sea level dramatically, the continued existence of the world’s great coastal cities — Miami, New York, Shanghai and many more — is tied to Antarctica’s fate.”	This is the prime motive of understanding Antarctic ice sheet dynamics, especially since the far-field location gives Antarctica relatively more weight to sea level rise along many Northern Hemisphere cities than Greenland.	article62.txt
“about 56 million years ago … The planet proceeded to warm rapidly, at least in geologic terms, and major die-offs of some marine organisms followed due to strong acidification of the oceans.” 	There are several potential causes for the benthic extinctions that are seen in sediment cores. In addition to acidification, abrupt warming of bottom waters, decrease in dissolved oxygen and a potential decrease in food availability (raining down from surface layers) have been put forward in the past (e.g. Thomas [2003] Extinction and food at the seafloor…; Thomas [2007] Cenozoic mass extinctions in the deep sea…; Sluijs et al. [2007] The Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum super greenhouse…; McInerney and Wing [2011] The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum: A Perturbation of Carbon Cycle, Climate, and Biosphere with Implications for the Future).	
“Because the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet could raise the sea level dramatically, the continued existence of the world’s great coastal cities — Miami, New York, Shanghai and many more — is tied to Antarctica’s fate.”	The vulnerable parts of the ice sheet are those that resting on beds that are below sea level; therefore, the ice itself is in contact with a warming ocean. The majority of the West Antarctic and ~30% of the East Antarctic sectors of the ice sheet are grounded below sea level. 	article62.txt
nothing we can do to stop the Earth’s naturally occurring climate cycles.	Actually, studies suggest that we may already have postponed the next ice age by adding extra CO2 to the atmosphere which will take a long time to be removed by natural processes, and hence has committed the Earth to warmer temperatures than it would otherwise have had.	
“Warm weather worsened the most recent five-year drought, which included the driest four-year period on record in terms of statewide precipitation. California’s first-, second- and third-hottest years on record, in terms of statewide average temperatures, were 2014, 2015 and 2016.”	There is evidence that warmer temperatures across the globe affect large-scale atmospheric dynamics, which in turn feed into regional weather patterns. The relevant example here is the argument that a warming Arctic will reduce large-scale temperature gradients in the atmosphere, which will in turn affect (and be affected by) the complex path that storms follow across the Pacific Ocean as they approach the North American west coast. While the extent to which this has already happened is debatable*, there is agreement that it will be a robust signal if Arctic warming continues unabated*. Cohen et al (2014) Recent Arctic amplification and extreme mid-latitude weather, Nature Geoscience Overland et al (2015) Nonlinear response of mid-latitude weather to the changing Arctic, Nature Climate Change Screen (2017) Climate science: Far-flung effects of Arctic warming, Nature Geoscience 	article57.txt
“Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic’s summer sea-ice cover.”	This is incorrect. The SIPN team (Sea Ice Prediction Network) have collected forecasts from 40 international groups and none are predicting a record low in 2016.	article33.txt
I conclude that it must be ice accumulation, through evaporation of ocean water, and subsequent precipitation turning into ice. Evidence suggests that accumulation of ice on the Antarctic continent has been offsetting the steric effect for at least several centuries.	Satellite data show that mountain glaciers as well as the large ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica are all losing ice mass in recent decades, at an accelerating rate. Check out NASA’s data: Figure – GRACE Satellite measurements of ice mass variations in Antarctica and Greenland since 2003.	article99.txt
“Sea ice thickness also substantially declined in the latter half of the 20th century, the snow and ice data center said.”	This is an important change to emphasize because sea ice thickness is also an indicator of sea ice age. While thin sea ice can reform more quickly year to year, thick sea ice requires more time. The loss of thick sea ice is perhaps even more striking than the loss of ice area.	article47.txt
“On Tuesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) is set to classify the Louisiana disaster as the eighth flood considered to be a once-in-every-500-years event to have taken place in the US in little over 12 months.”	This last sentence seems to imply that this is exceptional. However, in a country as large as the USA, it is very well possible to have multiple events each year, that exceed 100 or 500-year frequency thresholds for a particular location. Note that for this case, for multiple locations, the 500-year rainfall amount was exceeded, which is indeed exceptional.	article32.txt
Instrumental temperature measurements over the past 150 years show no correlation between human emissions of CO2 and ­temperature.”	Instrumental temperature measurements over the last 150 years record weather/climate that is influenced by more than ONLY CO2. Natural variation must also be considered, including semi- to multi-decadal processes involving the ocean and atmosphere (e.g. El Niño-Southern Oscillation)	
“Typically, in such an attribution study, scientists will use sets of climate models — one set including the factors that drive human global warming and the other including purely “natural” factors — and see if an event like the one in question is more likely to occur in the first set of models. Researchers are getting better and better at performing these kinds of studies fast, in near real time.”	This is an accurate description of how extreme event attribution studies are conducted.	
spanning five countries	Going quickly through the authors I identified 7 countries: Brasil, US, France, Austria, Italy, Canada, United Kingdom (the list might not be complete).	article112.txt
“At the bottom of the world, sea ice is also at all-time record low levels around Antarctica, the data center said. The lack of ice in the Antarctic, where it is currently summer, is most pronounced in the Amundsen Sea, where only a few scattered patches of ice remain.”	This short example reveals why sea ice extent is a useful, but not sufficient diagnostic to characterize the recent sea ice variability.	article47.txt
“Incorporating recent advances in the understanding of how ice sheets might break apart, they found that both West Antarctica and some vulnerable parts of East Antarctica would go into an unstoppable collapse if the Earth continued to warm at a rapid pace. In their worst-case scenario, the sea level could rise by six feet by the end of this century, and the pace could pick up drastically in the 22nd century. Dr. DeConto and Dr. Pollard do not claim that this is a certainty — they acknowledge that their analysis is still rough — but they argue that the possibility should be taken seriously.”	Related to my earlier comment, the relevance of the “Marine Ice Cliff Instability” is still very unclear, and not generally accepted in the ice-sheet modeling community. DeConto and Pollard’s sea-level estimates certainly fall in the high end of sea-level rise projections. However, other processes such as non-linearities in melt or basal sliding may provide similar high-end estimates.	
“An “inherent bias” in scientific journals in favour of more calamitous predictions has excluded research showing that marine creatures are not damaged by ocean acidification, which is caused by the sea absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.” 	This is an inflammatory twisting of the author’s words. Browman discusses the well-known bias against publication of negative results. It has nothing to do with the direction of the signal, only the inability of the researchers to demonstrate an effect in their experiments. It has nothing to do with how “calamitous” the predictions are. In fact, sometimes the negative results would have been more calamitous depending on the experimental design.	
“For example, the Arctic heatwaves are made tens of times more likely and the soaring temperatures seen in Australia in February were made twice as likely.”	This statement is referring to rapid attribution analyses that were conducted by the World Weather Attribution group. We found that the Arctic heat of late 2016 was made much more likely by human-induced climate change (although it remains a very unusual event in the current climate). In another analysis, we found the February heatwave in New South Wales was at least twice as likely to occur because of climate change.	article54.txt
“The ocean has accelerated and is now rising at a rate of about a foot per century[…] The risk is that the rate will increase still more. Scientists who study the Earth’s history say waters could rise by a foot per decade in a worst-case scenario, though that looks unlikely. Many experts believe that even if emissions stopped tomorrow, 15 or 20 feet of sea level rise is already inevitable, enough to flood many cities unless trillions of dollars are spent protecting them. How long it will take is unclear. But if emissions continue apace, the ultimate rise could be 80 or 100 feet.”	It is accurate to say sea-level rise is approximately one foot per century. Present-day sea-level rise is a major indicator of climate change. Since the early 1990s, sea level rose at a mean rate of ~3.1 mm/yr (~1 foot over 100 years). It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100, with the amount of rise dependent on future emissions. The latest IPCC report estimates 1 to more than 3 m (up to ~10 feet) for high emission scenarios by 2300. But, those projections of sea-level rise may be limited by uncertainties surrounding the response of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. For example, the report projected a likely contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) of -8 to +15 cm under the high emissions scenario by 2100, but a recent coupled ice sheet and climate dynamics model suggests that the AIS could contribute more than 1 m by 2100, and more than 10 m by 2300, under that high emissions scenario.	
“CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent.”	Another helpful quote comes from this article: “The contribution of CO2 to the greenhouse effect, considerable though it is, understates the central role of the gas as a controller of climate. The atmosphere, if CO2 were removed from it, would cool enough that much of the water vapor would rain out. That precipitation, in turn, would cause further cooling and ultimately spiral Earth into a globally glaciated snowball state. It is only the present of CO2 that keeps Earth’s atmosphere warm enough to contain much water vapor.” I like to think of CO2 as analogous to a military commander and water vapor as analogous to an army of foot soldiers. Even though the water vapor foot soldiers do most of the fighting, the CO2 commander sends the army to battle.	article52.txt
The ­atmospheric residency time of carbon dioxide is five years and it is quickly sequestered into plants, marine life, oceans and sediments.	There are many papers that looked at the time it would take for natural negative feedbacks to remove the excess carbon from the atmosphere. It would take millennia*. Eby et al (2008) Lifetime of Anthropogenic Climate Change: Millennial Time Scales of Potential CO2 and Surface Temperature Perturbations, Journal of Climate 	
to avoid runaway climate change	I agree, “runaway climate change” is too strong here. It has a precise definition. Warming beyond 2°C, say by 3 or 4°C, is bad, but not the same as “runaway” (which, in my view at least, means that warming would then take a dynamics of its own, stop responding to any emission changes and slip up to several more degrees….).	article112.txt
This scientist proved climate change isn’t causing extreme weather 	The title is misleading. He didn’t prove anything. He’s simply claiming there are not yet definitive links between climate change and some extreme events. I would refer the readers to the most recent National Climate Assessment1 for a broader and longer list of salient impacts of climate change beyond the short and narrow selection quoted. 1 – US NCA (2018) Volume II: Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States 	article128.txt
“Two degrees is more significant than it sounds. […]The number may sound low, but as an average over the surface of an entire planet, it is actually high”	Note that the warming over land is about twice as large as the warming over the ocean. Over the ocean, more of the additional heat goes into evaporation of water rather than warming of the air. It furthermore takes time to heat up the oceans, just like a water kettle takes time to boil. Because there is more land in the Northern Hemisphere, it will warm more than the Southern Hemisphere. One way to see how much of a difference two degrees makes is to look at a region closer to the equator that is two degrees warmer. Nature will look very different.	
“The IPCC reports also don’t fully account for the albedo effect (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence more warming); more cloud cover (which traps heat); or the dieback of forests and other flora (which extract carbon from the atmosphere). Each of these promises to accelerate warming”	“More cloud cover (which traps heat)” is a gross over-simplification regarding the role of clouds as a tuning knob for Earth’s climate. While it is true that clouds can act as a blanket and trap more heat, they also serve to reflect sunlight (see the prior sentence regarding the albedo effect). Which cloud effect ultimately wins out has to do with the optical thickness of the cloud (how reflective it is) and (as a rough approximation), the cloud height. As a quick rule: Higher clouds will act better as a blanket since they are both colder (and therefore radiate less energy to space) and typically optically thin. Conversely, lower clouds act more as a reflector since they are warmer and optically thick. The IPCC report does generally show a net positive cloud feedback, indicating global cloud feedbacks will lead to additional warming, but cloud feedbacks are extremely complicated and highly uncertain.	
“The arc of global warming will be variously steep and less steep,’ said Richard Seager, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. ‘It never stopped.’”	This is another important point to make—there will be periods where the Earth warms less quickly (not every year will be a record year) but the heating of the Earth continues.	
“Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the average pH of global ocean surface waters have fallen from pH 8.2 to 8.1. This represents an increase in acidity of about 26%.”	Correct.	article78.txt
“Entire states and nations have to decide to clean up their energy systems”	This is correct. It cannot be done by only a few nations—it requires collective action to make a substantial difference.	article77.txt
“an individual heatwave triggering coral bleaching cannot be linked to global warming as the process triggering an individual heatwave is fundamentally different from that triggering global warming”	Unfortunately, even under the Paris Agreement, 2016-like heat will be more common*.

The amount of energy used to construct solar and wind facilities is greater than they produce in their working lives.	Numbers for “Energy Return on Investment” (EROI) are all over the place, but a nice summary with references to supporting information was produced for Scientific American by Mason Inman for the April 2013 edition of Scientific American. Mason estimated that wind returns about 20 times the energy input and solar around 6 times their energy input. While these numbers do depend on a range of assumptions, the idea that these ratios are less than one is wrong and not defensible. The construction of wind turbines and solar panels does result in some carbon dioxide emission but far less than would be emitted were that electricity generated using fossil fuels such as coal, gas, or oil. Therefore, if the alternative is fossil fuels, these technologies help avoid carbon dioxide emissions. It should be noted that Energy Return on Investment is likely to increase over time as the economy becomes more efficient and thus economic inputs to the production of energy technologies becomes less energy intensive	
” ‘CO2 is going up, but nowhere near as fast as they thought it would. The computer models just weren’t reliable.’ ”	This statement is just plain wrong. Atmospheric CO2 content has recently surpassed 400 ppm and this rate of increase is in line with model projections.	
“Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea-level rise, leading to net land-area gain. This is not only true for the Marshall Islands. […]several studies have documented noteworthy shoreline progradation [growth] and positional changes of islands since the mid-20th century, resulting in a net increase in island area.”	As wave energy and rising sea levels batter coastlines, the erosional products (i.e. sediments) can either be accreted onto the existing land or removed offshore into the deep ocean. Where the sediment is redistributed depends on a number of factors. Although sediment accretion can increase land area, it does little to change the elevation of low-lying islands, like the Marshall Islands. Therefore, people living in low-lying areas, even if there is historical land area gain, are still susceptible to inundation and damages due to storm waves, higher-than-usual tides (e.g. king tides), and sea level rise. These unconsolidated, loose sediments are also easily mobilized; therefore, localized land area gains by sediment accretion can be very dynamic on short timescales. This article could leave readers thinking that land area gains alone can mitigate the effects of sea level rise on low-lying coastal areas, but land elevation is what is really important.	
“The Northern Hemisphere jet stream […] flow is stronger when that temperature difference is large. But when the Arctic warms up faster than the equator does […] the jet stream’s flow can become weakened and elongated. That’s when you can get the resultant weather extremes.”	This is an accurate and succinct description of the primary hypothesized mechanism involved in the Arctic/mid-latitude weather linkage.	
“In 2004, two NOAA scientists, Richard Feely and Christopher Sabine, produced a chart showing a strong correlation between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and falling oceanic pH levels. But then, just over a year ago, Mike Wallace, a hydrologist with 30 years’ experience, noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information[…] his results were surprising: there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last -century.”	This is plain wrong. Oceanic pH levels decreased by 0.1 units compared to pre-industrial levels. This corresponds to a 30% increase in acidity. For a primer on pH, see this NOAA explainer.

and increase monthly utility costs for hardworking families	This is unlikely. Other modeled analyses, such as those for the Clean Power Plan, have shown that monthly utility costs would decline under action due to increased energy efficiency investments.

But each serial adjustment has tended to make the early years colder, which increases the warming trend.	This is absolutely wrong. The adjustments to the global average warming REDUCE the trend, not increase it.	article130.txt
Dr Willie Soon’s comparison of temperature data and water vapour [Figure]	After including a quote about correlation not being equivalent to causation, this figure is an odd inclusion as there is no explanation as to its purpose other than to (apparently) illustrate the correlation between water vapour and temperature.	
	This is only true if you selectively pick studies with low sensitivity. We recently looked at all climate sensitivity studies published using all different methods and found no evidence of an overall decline in estimated ECS in recent years: 	
“Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is one of the world’s greatest reservoirs of biodiversity.  A World Heritage site, it is currently under assault from unusually hot ocean temperatures,”	Note that there is also a possibility that ocean acidification is contributing stress to coral reef systems, making them more susceptible to bleaching from high seawater temperatures.	
“But the air is already so full of greenhouse gases that most land ice on the planet has started to melt.”	I think this is not a very accurate statement and should be nuanced. Rather than ‘melt’, one should talk about ‘mass loss’ (or ‘mass gain’), as melt is not the only process adding to sea-level change. Especially on Antarctica, ice discharge [ice sliding into the ocean] plays a much more important role than melt, as over large parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (i.e. inland East Antarctica) the temperatures are so low that surface melt, even in summer, is not an issue at present (see eg these maps of Antarctica surface melt area). If we step away from the ‘melt’ however, […] most glaciers on Earth are suffering from mass loss (IPCC AR5 Chapter 4: “Since AR4 (in 2007), almost all glaciers worldwide have continued to shrink as revealed by the time series of measured changes in glacier length, area, volume and mass”).

“Consider where they move. Migration patterns show people heading for warm states like Texas and Florida, not snowy Minnesota and Michigan.”	This has more to do with economic factors than weather. If people moved only because of poor weather, why hasn’t everyone left Northern Europe? 	article25.txt
“Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free. You will be able to cross over the north pole by ship. There will still be about a million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic in summer but it will be packed into various nooks and crannies”	Telegraph, 2011 – “ice free by 2015”; Guardian, 2012 – “ice free by 2015 or 2016”; Financial Times, 2013 – “ice free no later than 2015”.	article33.txt
“This means it is possible that by some yardsticks, 2016 will be declared as hot as 2015 or even slightly hotter – because El Nino did not vanish until the middle of the year.”	It is virtually certain that 2016 will be warmer than 2015. See for example this estimate of the 2016 average temperature based on the GISS data up to October. 	article43.txt
“The blue bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted downwards to make it cooler; the red bars show where the raw temperature data has been adjusted upwards to make it warmer.”	Adjustments are made for good reasons. One of the most common ones is to account for a station located in a growing city, where the urban heat island effect would add spurious warming. In most cases the adjustments reduce, not increase, the warming in the record.	article68.txt
“Construction and maintenance of wind and solar facilities ­release far more carbon dioxide than they are meant to save over their working lives and they need to be sup­ported 24/7 by coal-fired generators.”	This is completely incorrect. There are numerous studies contradicting this. For example, see a series of studies by Sally Benson at Stanford University. Frankly, both parts of this claim are absurd. Coal-fired generators are particularly poorly-suited to act as a backup for solar because they generally are very expensive to ramp up and down, so they are used almost everywhere around the world as baseload generators. Natural gas or hydro are much better suited as backup. This sentence belies a lack of understanding of energy technologies and markets.	
“…climate change will also reduce the number of cold days and cold spells. That will cut the total number of cold-related deaths.”	The assertion that warmer winters = less mortality is a schoolboy error. Indeed everyone knows that European countries with warmer climates and milder winters actually have MORE not LESS winter mortality; principally due to adaptation. The current numbers of winter mortality may well be higher than summer heat wave mortality in many temperate to northern countries, however what is crucially important is that evidence points to significant increase in summer heat related mortality and no or very little change to winter mortality as a result of climate change.	
“Even more heretical than his enthusiasm for fracking is Lovelock’s passionate support for nuclear power.”	Here Lovelock is less heretical than he thinks; most future energy scenarios that meet aggressive climate goals show an expansion of nuclear energy, particularly in countries like China. There is something of an open question whether Nuclear will remain cost-competitive with other near-zero carbon technologies, however, given how quickly the costs of these technologies have fallen: Source: energy.gov	article37.txt
In 2004, two NOAA scientists, Richard Feely and Christopher Sabine, produced a chart showing a strong correlation between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and falling oceanic pH levels. But then, just over a year ago, Mike Wallace, a hydrologist with 30 years’ experience, noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information[…] his results were surprising: there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last -century.”	This statement just flies in both the face of observational facts and a basic understanding of chemistry. I would love to hear a cogent explanation of how atmospheric CO2 levels could rise over the course of a century without producing a decrease in ocean pH. Observations near Hawaii and several other open ocean environments show clear decreasing trends in ocean pH. See, for example this report from the European Environment Agency. It is one thing to challenge future projections, but rejecting well-established scientific facts is another thing entirely. Figure: Decline in pH measured at the Aloha station as part of the Hawaii Ocean time-series. Source	
natural warm times, like now, bring great prosperity, increased longevity and less disease, whereas Jack Frost brings death, depopulation and economic stresses.	This is a common misconception. We are not talking about minor climate fluctuations, we are experiencing a major, abrupt climate change. Because current climate change is so fast, ecosystems are at risk, infrastructure is at risk, and the result will certainly not bring great prosperity. Climate change related health impacts are also on the rise, so there will certainly not be “less disease” 	
How is this possible 2,999,971 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger bought his Hummer?	It is possible because CO2 sources (e.g. volcanic degassing) and CO2 sinks (e.g. from chemical weathering of the Earth’s surface) were differently balanced back then. It is not a mystery, it is well understood science that has countless papers about it, and a serious journalist (if they profess to be one) would have made some effort to educate themselves before writing such an article.	article125.txt
But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change.”	This is correct. While many countries show gradual declines in their emissions, global emissions are not yet declining. The past few years, global annual CO2 emissions have not increased as much as they did previously and remained roughly constant. However, to halt global mean temperature rise annual CO2 emissions have to become zero.	article77.txt
“The U.S. National Climate Assessment found that U.S. heat waves have already “become more frequent and intense,” that the U.S. is shattering high temperature records far more frequently than it is shattering low temperature records (just as you’d expect), and that it is seeing correspondingly fewer cold spells.”	This is true and is also consistent with findings from other areas of the world. For example, Dr Sophie Lewis led work that showed in Australia there have been 12 times as many hot records compared to cold records since 2000.	
“But [climate scientists] say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse.”	It is true that for a Harvey-like event—a storm at this location in East Texas that is nearly stationary—global warming likely increases the total rainfall. But we do not know whether global warming makes it more likely for a Harvey-like events to occur in the first place. Risk combines both of these probabilities. In combination, then, it is difficult to say whether there is a climate change effect on this type of flood risk. For more details on what can be said about the influence of climate change on Hurricane Harvey, read this claim review post.	
“This means the global temperature trend has now shown no further warming for 19 years”	This statement is false. Global temperatures continue their long-term warming trend.	article60.txt
“finding out how fast these glaciers will collapse is one of the most important scientific questions in the world today”	There are many important science questions, but it is true that understanding the rate of ice loss at Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers is very important for understanding how quickly future sea level rise will happen. Understanding Thwaites is arguably more important than Pine Island, though they are part of a connect region of ice. A recent peer-reviewed science article that takes a closer look at the question and explains the importance of understanding changes is Scambos et al, 2017*. Scambos et al (2017) How much, how fast?: A science review and outlook for research on the instability of Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier in the 21st century, Global and Planetary Change 	article82.txt
“[…]until we develop a practical, cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuels, it is unlikely that renewable energy will ever make up more than 15-20% of global energy requirements.”	In many countries renewables are already competitive compared to fossil fuels, and represent a larger share than the 15-20% mentioned here. Costs of renewable are still falling. And the investment in renewable is accelerating. For instance, the IEA has revised its renewable forecasts upwards. Many scenarios and studies foresee that renewables could represent a much larger share than 15-20%.	
“As the planet warms in response to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the ratio of high temperature records compared to low temperature records has become more skewed. If the climate weren’t warming, that long-term ratio should average out to about 1-to-1.”	The shift towards more warm extremes suggests the underlying distributions (weather) are changing. The climatology is shifting towards higher temperatures.	
“That is especially bad because the Amazon alone provides 20 percent of our oxygen.”	This sentence somehow implies that deforesting the Amazon would reduce atmospheric oxygen by 20%. This is not true. To quote Wally Broecker, who is cited later in the article: “Simply put, our atmosphere is endowed with such an enormous reserve of this gas that even if we were to burn all our fossil fuel reserves, all our trees, and all the organic matter stored in soils, we would use up only a few percent of the available O2. No matter how foolishly we treat our environmental heritage, we simply don’t have the capacity to put more than a small dent in our O2 supply. Furthermore, the Earth’s forests do not play a dominant role in maintaining O2 reserves, because they consume just as much of this gas as they produce. In the tropics, ants, termites, bacteria, and fungi eat nearly the entire photosynthetic O2 product. Only a tiny fraction of the organic matter they produce accumulates in swamps and soils or is carried down the rivers for burial on the sea floor.”	
“The growth is largely attributable to just two huge glaciers — Pine Island and Thwaites. The latter is increasingly being viewed as posing a potential planetary emergency, because of its enormous size and its role as a gateway that could allow the ocean to someday access the entirety of West Antarctica, turning the marine-based ice sheet into a new sea.”	This is known as the Marine Ice Sheet Instability hypothesis (MISI), see Box 13.2 in the latest IPCC report (Working Group 1). Figure – Schematic of the processes leading to the potentially unstable retreat of a grounding line showing (a) geometry and ice fluxes of a marine icesheet, (b) the grounding line in steady state, (c) climate change triggering mass outflow from the ice sheet and the start of grounding line retreat and (d) self-sustainedretreat of the grounding line.

“Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions.”	Others have already commented on this in detail. Just to emphasize: the statement is clearly misleading. What matters here is how human emissions drive the net atmospheric CO2 budget (emissions minus uptake) out of balance, which leads to an accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere.	
“With more CO2 in the atmosphere, the challenge [feeding 2.5 billion more people] can and will be met.”	This is very naïve. Many factors control food production. If further large changes in climate come to pass, no amount of extra CO2 will improve food security.	
But efforts to determine what causes seas to rise are marred by poor data and disagreements about methodology. 	This is not correct. First of all, the oceans are warming and warming water expands—a basic law of physics. Second, mountain glaciers and ice sheets are melting due to global warming, adding water to the ocean—an observational fact. Third, independent estimates of these contributions to sea-level rise match the actually observed sea level rise. 	article99.txt
running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit.	The Earth’s climate has always varied, even before humans began to influence it. Climate scientists have always been very clear about this. But human-caused emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases have now added a new cause of climate change in addition to the existing causes of natural climate variability.	article125.txt
“[Sea ice] also helps regulate the planet’s temperature by influencing the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean. It can affect weather in the U.S.”	Sea ice cover is also better at reflecting energy from the sun than open ocean. This makes sea ice an important player in keeping the ocean surface from taking up additional heat.	
Computer models of the climate are at the heart of calls to ban the cheap, reliable energy that powers our thriving economy and promotes healthier, longer lives.	Also, without numerical computer models we have many lines of evidence that climate change is a problem (basic physics, observed changes, climatic changes in the deep past). The uncertainties and thus the risks would be higher. There would thus be a greater urgency to reduce risks without climate models.	article130.txt
“In the geological past, Earth’s atmosphere had hundreds of times the CO2 content of the modern atmosphere yet there were no carbon dioxide-driven catastrophes. The past shows that climate change is normal, that warmer times and more atmospheric carbon dioxide have driven biodiversity and that cold times kill.”	Indeed, climate change is normal, but there are 2 important differences with respect to the geological record: 1) the current rate of increase in CO2 is unprecedented and 2) the current CO2 increase is caused by human emissions.	
“And the gist is that when it comes to extreme heat waves in general — heat waves that appear out of the norm in some way, for instance in their intensity, frequency, or duration — while scientists never say individual events are “caused” by climate change, they are getting less and less circumspect about making some connection.”	“Climate change” is by definition a shift in the weather statistics, such as the curve that describes the likelihood of temperatures exceeding a certain threshold [see figure below]. The temperature has a statistical character that is close to being bell-shaped (normal distribution), which implies that high temperatures are expected to be more frequent with a global warming – unless the typical range of temperatures (standard deviation) or shape of the curve changes as well. Climate is the typical character outlined by this curve (probability density function) describing the probabilities, whereas weather is each different data point on which this curve is based. When referring to one event – one data point – one talks about weather. Weather is not the same as climate, but they are related: climate is the expected weather. Figure illustrating how a change in climate influences the frequency of extreme heat events: an increase in the average temperature (upper panel) causes a large increase in the probability of extreme hot events; a change in the climate variability (lower panels) can further alter the frequency of extreme events. – adapted from IPCC report (2001) 	
Furthermore, whereas in 2008 most of the ice was extremely thin, this year most has been at least two metres thick.”	Arctic sea ice volume has actually exhibited record thinness so far during 2017—beating the previous record years of 2012/2016 by a wide margin. Another nice visualization by Zachary Labe illustrates this quite clearly: 	article60.txt
“Within a decade, certain kinds of branching and plate coral could be extinct, reef scientists say, along with a variety of small fish that rely on them for protection from predators.”	I think it is very unlikely any corals would be extinct in a decade. The problem isn’t threat of extinction, its loss of habitat for other critters when corals bleach and die. The corals become less dense, but there will still be many millions of colonies for most species.	article53.txt
“Antarctica, the planet’s largest ice sheet, lost 219 billion tons of ice annually from 2012 through 2017 — approximately triple the 73 billion ton melt rate of a decade ago, the scientists concluded. From 1992 through 1997, Antarctica lost 49 billion tons of ice annually.”	This is a correct summary of the results from the study. 	
it still has not been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive ­global warming. 	This is so trivially wrong and such old well-established science, that I hope a Wikipedia link is allowed.	
“The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever. Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.”	While the CO2 does not impact our health through “disease-causing pollutants that get into people’s lungs”, it does change our environment and the Earth’s climate, and in that sense it does classify as a pollutant.	
“Yet, a new study of 60 climate models and scenarios shows this warning fails to take into account the fact that global warming will mean precipitation increases. Indeed, water flow will actually increase over this century, which is likely beneficial in increasing “water availability in the Indus Basin irrigation scheme during the spring growing seasons.” ”	The issue of drinking water availability is more nuanced than either extreme represented here. Increases in glacier melt can have a wide range of impacts depending on the location and timing of the change. For example, complete loss of an alpine glacier that is used for summer drinking water can result in dramatic water shortages for those communities. On the other hand, increasing glacier melt can mean short term (decades) increases in river water – such as for the upper Indus basin noted in this study. Unfortunately, increased water availability from glacier loss is bound to end once those glaciers disappear.   2.4. It is not obvious that winter-related death will decrease due to climate change, contrary to Lomborg’s claim 	
How is this possible 2,999,971 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger bought his Hummer?	Because the amount of CO2 naturally present in the atmosphere depends on how much is being released or taken up by the oceans, land ecosystems, and chemical reactions involved in rock weathering. These change naturally, but gradually, over thousands or millions of years. Human emissions of CO2 are merely adding an extra factor to the equation, but it is one which has a big effect over much short timescales (the last few decades).	article125.txt
Already, scientists know enough to be concerned. About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades. The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, implying that the ice sheets in both Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated, a warning of what could occur in the relatively near future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked.”	This is factually correct. Indeed, past climate states analogous to the state which is expected to manifest in the near future, are characterized by much higher sea levels. This implies that the current Antarctic (and Greenland) ice sheet volumes are not consistent with warmer climate states. Rather, warmer climate states are consistent with smaller ice sheets. “Relatively near future” is probably a misleading statement in the text, because it implies to average people a decadal timeframe—almost certainly unrealistic for 20-30 ft of sea level rise.	
But efforts to determine what causes seas to rise are marred by poor data and disagreements about methodology. 	I think this is a misinterpretation of what is currently known about sea level rise where we know that roughly 50% comes from glaciers’ mass loss, and the other 50% comes from volume expansion because of heat. There are multiple independent observation systems that confirm the current knowledge.	article99.txt
Never mind that the emissions of carbon dioxide to make and maintain a wind or solar industrial complex are far greater than they will ever save.	This is completely incorrect.	
“The heat extremes were especially pervasive in the Arctic, with temperatures in the fall running 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across large stretches of the Arctic Ocean.”	Where the Arctic ocean freezes the air can get very cold because the ice blocks the heat transport from the relatively warm ocean water. The temperature variability is naturally larger in the Arctic than in the mid-latitudes (USA, Europe). Thus it was very warm in the Arctic. As NASA’s Gavin Schmidt said: “What’s going on in the Arctic is really very impressive; this year was ridiculously off the chart” But 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit may not be as exceptional as it sounds to our ears.	article86.txt
In its 5th assessment report in 2013, the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010. But it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere.	This is deceptive. Most published work suggests human activities are responsible for all, if not more than 100% of observed warming. 	
In the past, the atmospheric carbon dioxide content has been orders of magnitude higher than now, yet there were ice ages	This is a very bold (and wrong) statement. In the past 2 million years, CO2 has been lower than today and there were ice ages (glacials) when CO2 fell below a certain threshold. If we look further back, e.g. tens of millions of years, to periods of time when CO2 was higher than today (as in the Eocene), there was not much ice or snow around (if any)—certainly no ice age. If we go hundreds of millions of years back, the Sun was less strong than today. So yes, there might have been ice with higher CO2 concentrations and a faint Sun, but who knows? CO2 reconstructions do not go that far back.	
“Arctic land stores about twice as much carbon as the atmosphere. While growing seasons—which are now either longer or newly possible, depending on the exact location—suck in carbon dioxide during the spring and summer, scientists believe the thawing lands are now emitting more carbon than they take in.”	Yes, and in addition they will increase the methane that they emit, which may offset carbon that might be taken up if that is the case.	article58.txt
“The costs of emissions regulations, which will be paid by everyone, will be punishingly high and will provide no benefits to most people anywhere in the world.”	This is simply not accurate. Global warming is a global issue that, for example, affects global coastal populations, marine ecology, crop stability, and the area of habitable land. Humans, especially in countries with the largest carbon emissions, have been successfully altering the entire Earth system; therefore, climate change is currently the most global issue that we face and will continue to face in the coming centuries.	article40.txt
Carbon dioxide is a trace gas in the atmosphere.	This is the first officially true sentence due to its brevity. The rest of the paragraph shows it is intended to suggest something that is wrong.	
“Antarctica, the planet’s largest ice sheet, lost 219 billion tons of ice annually from 2012 through 2017 — approximately triple the 73 billion ton melt rate of a decade ago, the scientists concluded. From 1992 through 1997, Antarctica lost 49 billion tons of ice annually.”	This translates to about 0.6 mm/yr in 2012-2017, while the 1992-1997 rates were 0.14 mm/yr. This may not sound like much, but the current total rate of sea-level rise is around 3.2 mm/yr, so Antarctica is responsible for an increasingly large portion of the observed sea-level rise.	
“How did a wet Western winter lead to a sky-choking summer? The answer lies in the summer’s record-breaking heat, say wildfire experts. Days of near-100-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures cooked the Mountain West in early July, and a scorching heat wave lingered over the Pacific Northwest in early August.”	Exceptionally high summer air temperatures undoubtedly contributed to the extensive forest fire activity that occurred during the summer of 2017 in the western United States. Forest flammability is affected by both winter snowfall and seasonal rain, as well as by spring and summer air temperatures that regulate the timing of snowmelt and how much water the atmosphere will suck out of the forest.  	
“According to the satellites, the late 2016 temperatures are returning to the levels they were at after the 1998 El Nino.”	Even according to satellite records, which have their issues, this is not remotely the case:	article43.txt
“So it’s been a surprise to climate scientists that 2017 has been so remarkably warm — because the last El Niño ended a year ago.”	The claim that this is “a surprise to climate scientists” is not correct. In December 2016, climate scientists at the UK’s Met Office Hadley Centre predicted that 2017 would be “another very warm year for global temperatures”. 2017 was forecast to be among the warmest on record, but not as warm as 2016, so what is happening is actually consistent with the prediction.	article70.txt
“‘The dry periods are drier and the wet periods are wetter,’ said Jeffrey Mount, a water expert and senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.”	This is seen in assessments of atmospheric reanalyses, which show a decreasing frequency of rain-producing weather systems over California but higher rain rates over the last 35 years*.

This scientist proved climate change isn’t causing extreme weather 	The headline of this piece is incorrect. Nobody has “proved climate change isn’t causing extreme weather.” While just about everybody acknowledges that climate change is causing more record high temperatures and fewer record cold temperatures, the jury still is out on whether it can be said that climate change is causing other kinds of extreme weather, such as intense storms. There is a tendency by many to attribute every extreme event to climate change, and while that is not justified, in most cases of extreme weather there is insufficient data and understanding to make a clear determination of the extent to which climate change may or may not have played a role.	article128.txt
“When someone says, ‘climate science is settled,’ remind them to check the facts.”	The basic radiation physics has been well known for 150 years. The details will always be under discussion, but we are already seeing very clearly the expected patterns of climate change.	
it still has not been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive ­global warming.	This statement is wrong. CO2 is a greenhouse gas and human emissions are increasing its concentration. Human emissions therefore drive global warming1. This can be measured, it can be explained theoretically and it can be seen in the past evolution of temperatures and CO2. 1- Stips et al (2016) On the causal structure between CO2 and global temperature, Scientific Reports 	
“This chart gives you a good idea of the direction of the adjustments.”	This chart does not show the adjustments. It shows an unsourced graph with the difference between two datasets. This is also due to increases in the amount of data used and thus also increases in coverage. In as far as the reason are adjustments, a likely reason would be the adjustments of the sea surface temperature that make global warming smaller. Older bucket measurements are cooler than modern buoy measurements because the water cools by evaporation between taking the bucket out of the water and reading the thermometer. In the past these adjustments were thought to be larger than modern estimates. So the “scandal” here would be that scientists were conservative in their early estimate of global warming.	article68.txt
when 3 per cent of total annual global emissions of carbon dioxide are from humans and Australia prod­uces 1.3 per cent of this 3 per cent, then no amount of emissions reductio­n here will have any effect on global climate.	This is enormously misleading; humans are entirely responsible for the rapid increase in the greenhouse gas concentrations within the atmosphere over the last 150 years, primarily through the burning of fossil fuels.

One of the main areas of contention is the existence of two strange climate episodes known as The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age. The MWP lasted from about 950 to 1250AD, and temperature 	The author uses a common technique of confusing the climate in single region with the global climate. Statments such as this (or “this winter is so cold, we can call climate change off”) are irrelevant because they do not refer to the global climate.	
“climate economists see a positive externality, not a negative one, from the human influence on climate. (In technical lingo, the so-called social cost of carbon would be negative.)”	The social cost of carbon would indeed be negative for a low climate sensitivity. This is because the net impacts of climate change only turn negative at more pronounced warming, and this would occur in a more distant future for a low climate sensitivity. At the same time, the positive impacts of carbon dioxide fertilization would be unaffected.	article36.txt
“Warm weather worsened the most recent five-year drought, which included the driest four-year period on record in terms of statewide precipitation. California’s first-, second- and third-hottest years on record, in terms of statewide average temperatures, were 2014, 2015 and 2016.”	This claim is supported by a wide range of scientific research*. Record warmth during the recent drought has also been directly implicated in some of the most iconic drought impacts, such as extreme lack of Sierra Nevada snowpack* and a large increase in wildfire intensity*.

” ‘CO2 is going up, but nowhere near as fast as they thought it would. The computer models just weren’t reliable.’ ”	Zeke Hausfather, Research Scientist, Berkeley Earth: Lovelock seems rather confused on this point. CO2 has actually gone up a bit faster than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted back in the Fourth Assessment Report: But modeling CO2 concentrations isn’t really that complicated (at least in the short term), and not a big focus of the IPCC and climate modelers. Rather, they use a number of different future emission scenarios reflecting different paths society could take to estimate the future warming, sea level rise, precipitation changes, and other more complex emergent properties of the climate system. Lovelock seems to be mixing up CO2 concentrations with temperatures, but even temperatures have been well within the range projected by models. 	
“These effects could add 50% to the impact of global warming that is produced by rising carbon emissions.”	The sea-ice albedo feedback is thought to contribute about 10% to global warming (it’s the smallest of the various climate feedbacks); that’s including the impact of Antarctic sea-ice loss as well. So this estimate of 50% for Arctic sea-ice loss alone seems far too high. 	article33.txt
“the researchers calculated that the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from wet soils, or wetlands, will be higher than from drier soils[…] This finding, if further confirmed, could reorient calculations of the overall potential of permafrost to worsen global warming over the coming century.”	The statement is true and properly cautious about the results of the Knoblauch et al paper. The article could have included that the present estimate* for additional warming from the permafrost carbon feedback is on the order of 0.13–0.27 °C to give a more quantitative sense of the strength of the feedback.

“Burning gas instead of coal in power plants reduces emissions in the short run, though gas is still a fossil fuel and will have to be phased out in the long run.”	It is arguable whether natural gas is a reasonable solution even in the short run. I argued in favor of this 20 years ago, but nowadays we have to cut emissions more drastically than would be possible by switching to another fossil fuel. The CO2 coefficient of natural gas is still about 2/3 of that of coal. Efficiency factors of power plants are also somewhat better for natural gas than for coal. Overall, we might save a bit more than half of the emissions by switching to natural gas while renewables can save much more. Furthermore, given the long technical lifetime of power stations, the “short run” could easily extend to 2060 or more.	article77.txt
At one point, Smith showed a slide of two charts that he said demonstrated how the rate of sea-level rise does not equal the sharp spike in the consumption of fossil fuels.

Unless the past is understood, climate projections can be only highly speculative.	The past is quite well understood. Ice cores record the tight correlation between CO2 and temperatures over the past 800,000 years.

“Drought in the western U.S. pales in comparison to the mega-droughts tree rings tell us existed in centuries past.”	Note the comparing reconstructions of past droughts with climate model projections suggests that “future drought risk will likely exceed even the driest centuries of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (1100–1300 CE) in both moderate (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) future emissions scenarios, leading to unprecedented drought conditions during the last millennium”.

“…climate change will also reduce the number of cold days and cold spells. That will cut the total number of cold-related deaths.”	There is very limited scientific support for the claim that reducing the number of cold days (by which he apparently means winter) will reduce the number of cold-related deaths. Again, this is assuming winter mortality is temperature-dependent; an assumption not verified by research in the US and elsewhere.

These examples all illustrate that cherry picking record high temperatures in isolated locations tells absolutely nothing about the Earth’s climate.	This is a bizarre ending of this part of the article were the authors admit that their really bad method to study whether the weather becomes more extreme is a really bad method to study whether the weather becomes more extreme.

“‘The interaction between Arctic ocean temperatures and the loss of ice formation leading to continuing record minimums is clearly a climate change signal,’ said Thomas Mote, a geography research professor at the University of Georgia.”	Yes. The “ice-albedo feedback” has been evident in the Arctic for some years, contributing to “polar amplification”—the effect where polar latitudes warm at around twice the rate of the globe as a whole.	
“But as more data comes in, even the worst-case estimates may turn out to be too low: for example, researchers recently discovered that ice is melting more rapidly than expected from both Antarctica and Greenland, plus gained a better understanding of how melting ice sheets actually affect sea-level rise. ‘The unlikely scenarios are now, all of a sudden, becoming more probable than they once were thought to be,’ says Sweet.”	This is true, based on the research cited here. The dynamics of rapid ice sheet retreat remain uncertain which introduces uncertainty into the projections.

“Despite recent attempts to paint the United States as a major global polluter, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. is among the cleanest nations on the planet.”	This presumes a strong link between the cleanliness of a country’s air and its own emissions.

However, the vast majority of that pollution will have been emitted in Italy.	article64.txt
“while it’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s, there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice.”	There is evidence. Bromaghin et al 20151 and Hunter et al 20102 examine this issue. Bromaghin et al state, “Low survival from 2004 through 2006 led to a 25–50% decline in abundance. We hypothesize that low survival during this period resulted from (1) unfavorable ice conditions that limited access to prey during multiple seasons; and possibly, (2) low prey abundance. For reasons that are not clear, survival of adults and cubs began to improve in 2007 and abundance was comparatively stable from 2008 to 2010, with ~900 bears in 2010 (90% CI 606–1212). However, survival of subadult bears declined throughout the entire period. Reduced spatial and temporal availability of sea ice is expected to increasingly force population dynamics of polar bears as the climate continues to warm. However, in the short term, our findings suggest that factors other than sea ice can influence survival.” Hunter et al stated, “Deterministic models projected population growth in years with more extensive ice coverage (2001-2003) and population decline in years with less ice coverage (2004-2005). LTRE (life table response experiment) analysis showed that the reduction in lambda in years with low sea ice was due primarily to reduced adult female survival, and secondarily to reduced breeding. A stochastic model with two environmental states, good and poor sea ice conditions, projected a declining stochastic growth rate, log lambda(s), as the frequency of poor ice years increased. The observed frequency of poor ice years since 1979 would imply log lambda(s) approximate to -0.01, which agrees with available (albeit crude) observations of population size. The stochastic model was linked to a set of 10 GCMs compiled by the IPCC; the models were chosen for their ability to reproduce historical observations of sea ice and were forced with “business as usual” (A1B) greenhouse gas emissions. The resulting stochastic population projections showed drastic declines in the polar bear population by the end of the 21st century. These projections were instrumental in the decision to list the polar bear as a threatened species under the U. S.

“many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals (the primary prey of polar bears) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season, which is particularly conducive to fishing”	Both ringed seals and bearded seals are sea ice obligate species: there are significant conservation concerns about both species across the Arctic. The basis of the statement that the seals are thriving is unfounded in the peer-reviewed literature. Both species are listed under the US Endangered Species Act. The polar bears living north of the Bering Strait have not shown the same loss in body condition, survival, and reproduction noted in the neighboring Beaufort Sea because the ecosystems are vastly different in the distribution of continental shelf habitat: huge area in the Chukchi Sea, a narrow band in the Beaufort. Polar bear populations respond to local changes, and with 19 polar bear populations, there will be 19 different scenarios playing out over time. Loss of sea ice in the Chukchi Sea in winter 2017/18 may change the situation there. 	article94.txt
“this event poses severe risks to health — particularly for children and the elderly […] an extreme 2003 heat wave that affected Paris and Europe, and which has indeed been connected to climate change through statistical attribution analysis […] killed hundreds of people in Paris and London, and a recent study attributed at least some of those deaths, themselves, to climate change.”	The majority of injuries, illnesses, and deaths during heatwaves are preventable. A robust literature base documents individuals at higher risk during heatwaves, such as adults over the age of 65 years, infants, individuals with certain chronic diseases, and others. Heatwave early warning and response systems save lives; expanding these systems to more cities and increasing awareness of the health risks of high ambient temperatures could increase resilience as heatwaves increase in frequency, intensity, and duration. Another issue is that growing confidence that climate change is increasing the probability of heatwaves means some deaths during heatwaves could be attributed to climate change.	
“Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years. If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet, are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade?”	Sea level rise is indeed accelerating and is currently tracking predictions that are consistent with a roughly 1 meter (3 foot) rise by the end of the century. We are already seeing bad effects in places like Miami Beach.

“On the Pacific Coast, a climate pattern that had pushed billions of gallons of water toward Asia is now ending, so that in coming decades the sea is likely to rise quickly off states like Oregon and California.”	This statement is likely to be accurate.

Bromirski et al. (2011) specifically addressed the influence of decadal PDO/ENSO onto the west coast of America and demonstrated an influence of the PDO there, with a suppression of sea-level rise from the 80’s until 2005.

“Representatives from the Marshall Islands have been vocal about the need for strong global action on climate.

But this doesn’t mean that ‘the islands existence is not threatened’, notably in the future as sea level rise becomes more severe. So here, he is swapping a weak claim that he has supported for a much stronger one that he has not, a version of the red herring fallacy.	article38.txt
“This means the global temperature trend has now shown no further warming for 19 years”	This is blatantly false. Examine the trend here: Furthermore, a short time period of a few months in 2017 cannot say anything whatsoever about the long-term change in climate.	article60.txt
It is expected the report will focus on required changes to the energy system, rather than forests.	This appears to be the motivation for the authors’ statement. I don’t know if it is true that the role of forests will be under-appreciated (in the to-be-released IPCC report)—it would have been useful to get more perspective on this—but it is certainly reasonable to highlight the importance of forests.	article112.txt
“Sea level rise is global. But due to a variety of factors – including, for this part of the Atlantic coast, a likely weakening of the Gulf Stream, itself potentially a result of the melting of Greenland’s ice caps – south Floridians are feeling the effects more than many others. While there has been a mean rise of a little more than 3mm per year worldwide since the 1990s, in the last decade, the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually.”	The hypothesis that (a) the Gulf stream has weakened over this time interval and (b) that it is the primary driver of sea level rise acceleration seen farther north along the U.S. Atlantic coast is still debated (see for example, Kopp 2013)*. Kopp (2013) Does the mid-Atlantic United States sea level acceleration hot spot reflect ocean dynamic variability?, Geophysical Research Letters 	article56.txt
Even the BBC has admitted to Ofcom that the corporation is now biased on the matter because it no longer thinks there is a counter-argument.	The more pernicious issue that pervades media reporting of not just climate change but also many other fields of science and other issues is the false-balance paradigm that this article itself falls foul of repeatedly.	
“Scientists just discovered a massive, heretofore unknown, source of nitrogen”	That the rocks in the crust of the planet contain nitrogen has been known for in excess of a century. 	article96.txt
“His Gaia hypothesis, which contends that the earth is a single, self-regulating organism, is now accepted as the founding principle of most climate science […]”	Climate science is based on physical, biological, and chemical processes. There are feedbacks between these processes such as biological consumption of atmospheric CO2 by photosynthesis. However, the idea of a self-regulated Earth system due to biological activity is not a common principle of climate science.	
“And since the biggest risk to humanity is poverty, if we allow policymakers to have their way, the resulting energy poverty will indeed cause the deaths of some of our children and grandchildren.”	Poverty and energy poverty are indeed a risk for humanity; but current understanding shows that unmitigated climate change would hinder the efforts of poverty alleviation, because climate change impacts bear on most vulnerable countries and people.	article39.txt
“Is recent crazy weather tied to climate change? Some of it is.”	This is a reasonable short answer to an extremely challenging scientific question.	
by Ian Plimer	Ian Plimer is not a climate scientist (he is a geologist by training) and has a long and well established history with the mining and fossil fuel industry. This should have been clearly disclosed at the end of the article due to the obvious conflict of interest.
