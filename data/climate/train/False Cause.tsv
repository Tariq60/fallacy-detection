“Russian scientists who have investigated waters off their coast have detected more and more plumes of methane bubbling up from the seabed.”	However, there is evidence from a dedicated field campaign that the methane in ocean plumes does not affect the atmosphere: Extensive release of methane from Arctic seabed west of Svalbard during summer 2014 does not influence the atmosphere 	article33.txt
“cold kills many more people than heat.”	Mr. Lomborg is confusing seasonal mortality with temperature-related mortality. It is true that mortality is higher during winter than summer. However, it does not follow that winter mortality is temperature-dependent (which summer mortality is). Dave Mills and I reviewed the evidence and concluded that only a small proportion of winter mortality is likely associated with temperature. A growing numbers of publications are exploring associations between weather and winter mortality, with differences in methods and results. The country with the strongest association between winter mortality and temperature is England, which appears in other publications to be at least partly due to cold housing. Winter mortality is lower in northern European countries.	article25.txt
[…] the Roman Warming, the Dark Ages, the Medieval Warming and the Little Ice Age. These took place before industrialisation and were all driven by changes in the sun.	These climate fluctuations were small, regional and at a much smaller scale than what the planet experiences today. None of them were globally as warm as today. They were also driven by other forcings than greenhouse gases. The author is confused between small-scale natural variability and long-term irreversible large-scale change.	
“First, marine species that calcify have survived through millions of years when CO2 was at much higher levels; second, they are more than capable of adapting — even in the short term — to environmental change”	Many marine organisms respond to changes in calcium carbonate mineral saturation states. These depend not only on pH, but also on factors including amounts of carbon and calcium in the ocean. One of the most important factors is ocean alkalinity, which varies on time scale of many thousands of years. In the geologic past, when atmospheric CO2 was high, ocean alkalinity was also high, and so carbonate mineral saturation states could remain high. Unfortunately, on the timescale of centuries or decades, changes come too fast for the ocean’s natural processes to buffer ocean carbonate mineral saturation states. Directly comparing effects of high CO2 levels that developed in the geologic past over many millions of years with high CO2 levels developing today over decades and centuries shows a fundamental lack of understanding of well-established global geochemical cycles. This open access article explains some of the relevant chemistry: Cao et al (2016) Simulated effect of deep-sea sedimentation and terrestrial weathering on projections of ocean acidification, Journal of Geophysical Research Oceans 	article45.txt
“The UN has already said that 2016 is highly likely to break the annual record again, after 14 straight months of extreme heat aided by a hefty El Niño climatic event, a weather event that typically raises temperatures around the world.“	The influence of El Niño was likely not as large as it was in 1998. A large part of the warming was also in the Arctic, as Jan Lenaerts also argues below.	article31.txt
“In contrast, humans are now emitting about 10 billion tons annually — changing the planet much more rapidly.”	This is the current rate, but it’s worth pointing out that this rate is the result of exponential growth over the last decades, and that it was “only” 1-2 billion tons in the 50’s, for instance. In drawing the analogy with the PETM, one may also wonder how long the current rates can be sustained – if anything, compared to the 4,000 years of the PETM – given that such emissions are most likely unsustainable over the long-term, either because of fossil fuel availability constraints, or because of the adverse feedback of climate change on human societies. 	article24.txt
“Federal scientists have documented a sharp jump in this nuisance flooding — often called ‘sunny-day flooding’ — along both the East Coast and the Gulf Coast in recent years.”	This is a tricky one. Nuisance flooding on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts is the result of relative sea-level rise. Relative sea-level rise has a variety of components that give the rise a spatial signature. For example along the mid US Atlantic coast one-third of the rise is due to glacial isostatic adjustment with the remainder dominated by climatically driven sea-level rise. But in the Mississippi Delta the dominant driving force is subsidence. However, in the coming century these components will decrease in importance relative to climatically driven sea-level rise. 	
“An additional kick was supplied by an El Niño weather pattern that peaked in 2016 and temporarily warmed much of the surface of the planet, causing the hottest year in a historical record dating to 1880.”	This is a very common misconception even among scientists. The warming, bleaching, and coral loss is 100% due to greenhouse gas emissions, not the ENSO cycle and the fact that we were in a peak of the El Niño phase in early 2016. The Great Barrier Reef has experienced El Niño events for thousands of years, yet bleaching wasn’t observed there until 1998 when ocean warming pushed ocean temperatures just above the bleaching threshold.	article53.txt
Brooks added that Antarctic ice is growing.	While the extent of Antarctic sea ice is slightly growing, this growth does not affect sea level, because of Archimedes’ law. The land ice of the Antarctic Ice Sheet is shrinking at an accelerating pace, which does result in sea-level rise.

“‘That isn’t going to sound horribly unmanageable. But remember for the northern hemisphere, for North America, the fact that the location in West Antarctica is where the action is amplifies that rate of sea level rise by up to an about additional 25 percent in a city like Boston or New York.’ That’s because as Antarctica’s mass shrinks, the ice sheet’s gravitational pull on the ocean relaxes somewhat, and the seas travel back across the globe to pile up far away — with U.S. coasts being one prime destination.”	This effect is called the gravitational effect, and it is the consequence of one of the basic laws of physics: mass attracts mass. When mass is lost on Antarctica, sea level will fall within a 2,200 km radius due to the loss of gravitational pull. Between 2,200 and 7,600 km, sea level will rise but less than the global average. Beyond 7,600 km, sea level rise will be larger than the global mean, up to 25% extra. For Antarctica, this means that the largest consequences will be in the Northern Hemisphere, with the reverse being true for mass loss in Greenland. The gravitational effect has been known since 18861, was rediscovered in 19762 and again in 20013. It is used in sea-level projections, for instance in the IPCC AR5 report, chapter 13. 1-Woodward (1886) On the form and position of the sea-level as dependent on superficial masses symmetrically disposed with respect to a radius of the Earth’s surface, Annals of Mathematics 2-Farrell and Clark (1976) On Postglacial Sea Level, Geophysical Journal International 3-Mitrovica et al (2001) Recent mass balance of polar ice sheets inferred from patterns of global sea-level change, Nature 	
“His Gaia hypothesis, which contends that the earth is a single, self-regulating organism, is now accepted as the founding principle of most climate science […]”	This is going a bit far. The Gaia gave many scientists food for thought, and a new way of thinking about the climate system in a holistic way, but it is hardly the “founding principle” of most climate science. That remains the physics of fluid flow and heat transport, plus chemistry and biology, etc.	
The strongest heat wave ever recorded [in the US] occurred in July 1936	People may know this period as the Dust Bowl, where bad land management practices produced bare soil, dust storms, crop failure, and heat waves. This affected especially the maximum temperature, the summer temperature and stations in the Dust Bowl region. Global warming is about global warming. There are other reasons why the temperature changes, but over the last century the main reason is the burning of fossil fuels. Locally, these other reasons can be significant—like the US Dust Bowl.	
“record temperatures brought in 2016 by an exceptionally strong El Niño”	Last year the annual global temperature was about 1.1 °C above a late-19th century baseline but only about 0.1°C of this was due to the El Niño—the other 1 °C is due to human influences. So while the record occurred in 2016 due to El Niño, most of the anomaly was due to climate change	article60.txt
frost fairs were held on the Thames when the river froze	The cessation of these frost fairs was linked to changes in river management and not to climate change. 	
“In 2013 the level of U.S. farm output was about 2.7 times its 1948 level, and productivity was growing at an average annual rate of 1.52%. From 2001 to 2013, world-wide, global output of total crop and livestock commodities was expanding at an average rate of 2.52% a year[…] Along with better plant varieties, cropping practices and fertilizer, CO2 has contributed to this welcome increase in productivity.”	In general, CO2 has had a positive effect on crop growth, but it’s impossible to separate historical effects from the greater effects of genetics and nitrogen and other inputs. However, it’s generally considered to be a fraction of those. We know better future effects because we have CO2 fertilization experiments in the field comparing present to future CO2 levels. Those experiments suggest that corn may have about a 1% gain [because of increased CO2] and soybeans 3-4 times that. However, these gains will almost certainly be offset by yield declines associated with the temperature increases caused by elevated CO2, which are well known. Historically, it’s worth noting that we had elevated CO2 long before we had the green revolution, and crop yields didn’t increase much until the green revolution. You can see this in graphs of average US corn yields from 1900. Source: University of Nebraska-Lincoln	
“‘Greenhouse gases emitted through human activities and the resulting increase in global mean temperatures are the most likely underlying cause of the sea ice decline,’ the snow and ice data center said.”	Observed trends in Arctic sea ice result from the superposition of forced, man-made variations and internally generated variations. While it is clear from the literature (see IPCC WG1 AR5 Chapter 10 for a review) that observed trends cannot be explained by internal variability alone, it should be remembered that internal variability can also modulate the forced trends, in a way that is complex to properly describe. In conclusion, greenhouse gases are well responsible for the observed decline, but their effect on sea ice trends may have even been amplified by internal variability. 	
“‘That isn’t going to sound horribly unmanageable. But remember for the northern hemisphere, for North America, the fact that the location in West Antarctica is where the action is amplifies that rate of sea level rise by up to an about additional 25 percent in a city like Boston or New York.’ That’s because as Antarctica’s mass shrinks, the ice sheet’s gravitational pull on the ocean relaxes somewhat, and the seas travel back across the globe to pile up far away — with U.S. coasts being one prime destination.”	What Rob DeConto and Chris Mooney explain here are the “far-field” sea level rise effects of losing so much concentrated ice mass in West Antarctica. This loss of mass reduces the gravitational pull that Antarctica otherwise has on the ocean, causing more water to slosh away from the far South. This just so happens to have a maximum impact on both coasts of North America, as illustrated in the Climate Science Special Report released in 2017 as part of the 4th National Climate Assessment undertaken by US federal agencies and universities. Figure 12.1 in the Sea Level Rise chapter shows that an extra 1.4 feet per century of relative sea level rise can be expected for North America (data originally from Kopp et al*), coming largely from the two largest West Antarctic glaciers—Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers.

“Houlton has been exploring this possibility for years. Back in 2011, he reported that forest trees can tap into nitrogen found in rock. At the time, he said ‘the stunning finding that forests can also feed on nitrogen in rocks has the potential to change all projections related to climate change,’ because it meant there could be more carbon storage on land and less in the atmosphere than climate models say.”	It should be noted that much of the Net Primary Productivity arises from grasses and other non-boreal sources. If only trees that are deep rooted enough to reach bedrock can tap this source then the potential is very much geographically limited.	
as continents rise after the overlying ice has melted	Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) also causes subsidence of the solid Earth surface in the regions located outside the margins of the former ice sheets (for instance, along the U.S. East coast, where GIA-related subsidence is exacerbating the effects of global mean sea level rise).	article99.txt
“many scientists were surprised when other researchers subsequently found that ringed and bearded seals (the primary prey of polar bears) north of the Bering Strait especially thrived with a longer open-water season, which is particularly conducive to fishing”	The Chukchi sea is essentially all continental shelf and is probably the most productive of the Arctic Seas. This is in contrast to the Beaufort Sea which, beyond the very narrow continental shelf, is very unproductive. Recent research has shown that this tremendous productivity and the fact that, although ice has significantly retreated, bears there still have fewer ice free days over the shelf than in the Beaufort, can explain why Chukchi Sea polar bears have not yet declined like those in the Beaufort.	article94.txt
“The warmer the planet gets, the more ozone forms, and by mid-century, Americans will likely suffer a 70 percent increase in unhealthy ozone smog, the National Center for Atmospheric Research has projected.”	Note that ozone concentrations are also determined by emissions of NOx and hydrocarbons, which can be controlled. 	
when 3 per cent of total annual global emissions of carbon dioxide are from humans and Australia prod­uces 1.3 per cent of this 3 per cent, then no amount of emissions reductio­n here will have any effect on global climate.	The natural emissions are balanced by natural sinks (comparable to our bank accounts, salary comes in, rent or mortgage goes out, grocery bills go out, the incoming and outgoing fluxes are high, but at the end of the month we end up with more or less the same amount of money we started with). Human emissions are on top of this fine natural balance. Humans add CO2 but they don’t remove CO2. And while this would be great news for our bank accounts, it’s not great news for our planet. 	
” ‘You’ve only got to look at Singapore. It’s two-and-a-half times higher than the worst-case scenario for climate change, and it’s one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in.’ ”	Desirability of a location has nothing to do with how safe it is from the effects of climate change. 	
If human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming, why have there been slight warmings and coolings since the Industrial Revolution?	Because the Earth’s climate is not static and contains internal variability on time-scales from years to multiple decades. Volcanic eruptions can also alter the climate by injecting aerosols into the atmosphere which have a cooling effect. Because there are other drivers of change too, such as aerosol particles that have an overall cooling effect. There is also internal climate variability. Nevertheless, the long-term warming is attributable to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.	
Because it’s getting warmer, there’s more CO2 coming out which means it’s going to get warmer which means there’s more CO2 coming out[…] And it will just run away with itself.”	This is a simplistic description of a positive feedback. Yes, warming would lead to release of carbon from soils and permafrost, and this would lead to more warming, hence more carbon loss. But in no way would this lead to a runaway feedback. Say a warming of 1°C led to a release of carbon from soils that induces an additional warming of 0.1°C (that’s quite a large positive feedback: 10% of the initial perturbation). This additional 0.1°C would lead to an additional release of carbon, inducing an additional warming of 0.01°C, which will lead to more carbon released and an additional 0.001°C warming, etc… Ultimately, warming will be 1.111…°C—larger than the initial warming of 1°C but quite far from a runaway scenario.	
“Since 1880, NOAA’s records show only one other instance when global temperature records were set three years in a row: in 1939, 1940 and 1941.”	The start of the second world war also changed the composition of the fleet making the sea surface temperature observations and with it the measurement methods used changed quickly. Climatologists have made adjustments to account for this problem, but it is well possible that this was incomplete. Uncertainties in this period are larger than in the decades before and after. Thus it could well be that these three records in a row are due to remaining problems. I would not have emphasised it. 	article86.txt
“But the new research shows that the amount of oxygen in those shells doesn’t actually remain constant over time.”	It’s nothing to do with the amount of Oxygen. It’s CaCO3, so oxygen content is pretty much fixed—it’s the isotopic ratio of the oxygen that is incorporated.	
We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit. 	This confounds natural variations in CO2 in the geological past with human-caused emissions today. Yes, CO2 has changed naturally over time, causing changes to climate, but the high levels and rapid increase we are seeing today is because of human-caused emissions.	article125.txt
“To make matters worse, the water temperatures in the Arctic Ocean are several degrees above average, which is an expected result of having less sea ice.”	Generally, the absorbed solar radiation leads to enhanced ocean temperatures in the mixed layer, so with summers of less ice the ocean mixed layer temperatures are usually warmer than average. Though even that is more driven by the timing of when the sea ice retreats. If it retreats early in the melt season when the sun is still high in the sky then you get more ocean warming, but if like in 2012 the ice retreats rapidly in August, it doesn’t have the same impact on ocean temperatures because the sun is already starting to set. But while this may be part of the explanation for warmer ocean temperatures at the moment, in the Barents Sea it is actually a result of warm Atlantic waters entering the Arctic. I have spoken with oceanographers about this and the sea surface temperature anomalies are a result of stronger inflow to the Barents Sea and along the west coast of Svalbard. The strong northwards flow of Atlantic water is also consistent with the more southerly winds this November that have helped to bring in warm air temperatures.	article41.txt
