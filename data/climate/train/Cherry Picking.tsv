“climate economists see a positive externality, not a negative one, from the human influence on climate. (In technical lingo, the so-called social cost of carbon would be negative.)”	This is cherry-picking at its worst. You can always find an economist who will make enough assumptions so that he or she can give you the answer you want. In this case (references the social cost of carbon), you can get a benefit ONLY if you assume a very high discount rate (like 5% so that future generations do not matter), and you ignore equity issues, and you assume that warmer climates in the crop-intensive areas will not include an increase in the intensity and/or frequency of intense weather (drought, floods, etc….), and you do not recognize that warmer temperatures mean more pests and more weeds. see the Summary for Policymakers of the Report of Working Group II to the fourth assessment of the IPCC	article36.txt
The latest U.N. science compendium asserts that the latter half-degree is at least half manmade.	The recent US National Climate Assessment1 finds that it is extremely likely that more than half of the temperature rise since 1951 is human-caused, and the likely human contribution is 93% to 123%. More than 100% means that the human caused warming would be higher, except that other unrelated changes caused cooling that partially offset the warming. 1- Fourth National Climate Assessment (2018) Part 1, Chapter 3	article130.txt
“‘If we are right, our study challenges decades of paleoclimate research,” said Anders Meibom, the head of EPFL’s Laboratory for Biological Geochemistry and a professor at the University of Lausanne.”	It only potentially challenges ONE method used to reconstruct past temperatures. Other methods and observations based on biomarkers, pollen, large fossils support a much warmer ocean at this time.	
“a killer analysis conducted by Craig Idso of all the studies which have been done on the effects of reduced pH levels on marine life.”	This publication is not peer-reviewed, cherry-picks articles and does not involve proper statistical testing. It does not, therefore, qualify as a “killer analysis”! The comprehensive metanalysis that was performed by Kroeker et al. (2013) revealed decreased survival, calcification, growth, development and abundance in response to acidification when the broad range of marine organisms is pooled together. However, the magnitude of these responses varies among taxonomic groups.

“Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free. You will be able to cross over the north pole by ship. There will still be about a million square kilometres of ice in the Arctic in summer but it will be packed into various nooks and crannies”	I would also add that predictions of an ice-free Arctic (also defined as ~1 million square kilometers of remaining ice) are shown to be subject to quite a bit of uncertainty stemming from natural variability – on the order of about two decades.	article33.txt
“Research shows that this process is overpowering the erosion from sea-level rise, leading to net land-area gain. This is not only true for the Marshall Islands. […]several studies have documented noteworthy shoreline progradation [growth] and positional changes of islands since the mid-20th century, resulting in a net increase in island area.”	The dynamics of sand accretion and loss across the tropical Pacific is indeed complicated, and many atolls are at the moment growing. However, as sea levels rise in this area of the globe, water tables also rise and become salinated, reducing the availability of fresh water for drinking or agriculture. Focusing on the tropical Pacific takes attention away from regions where the signal is much clearer, e.g. the east coast of the USA. The occurrence of “nuisance flooding” and coastal inundation has risen dramatically in recent decades. Another 50-100 centimeters of sea level rise globally threatens vast swaths of built infrastructure and hundreds of millions of lives. Whether or not Pacific atolls accrete or shrink is not the most central issue. 	
“[The West Antarctic Ice Sheet] is known to be losing ice rapidly because it is being melted from below by warm ocean waters, a process that is rendering its largest glaciers unstable.”	This is accurate but doesn’t fully explain that the warm ocean water is not a result of human-caused climate change and it is not a linear warming of Southern Ocean waters that causes melt beneath West Antarctic ice shelves. Rather, it is variability in the delivery of this relatively warm water (called Circumpolar Deep Water) that can directly affect how much melt is happening. Delivery of this water is altered by the direction and strength of winds over the Amundsen Sea, a subset of the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. If winds blow from west to east across the Amundsen Sea, they promote upwelling of this deep water under ice shelves, promoting melt and hence increasing ice loss*.

“Even if we meet the Paris goals of two degrees warming, cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become close to uninhabitable, annually encountering deadly heat waves like those that crippled them in 2015. At four degrees, the deadly European heat wave of 2003, which killed as many as 2,000 people a day, will be a normal summer. At six[…] summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley, and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone, anywhere, in the world today[…].”	The article highlights worst case projections of the intensity of heatwaves, but not of their frequency. Projections indicate return periods of high-mortality heatwaves will shorten over the century and, in some cases, the length of these high-mortality heatwaves will increase.  That does not mean these events will occur every day during a summer. In many regions, this means a high-mortality heatwave could occur could approach becoming an annual event instead of rarely. Further, the projections do not take into account that increased heat-related hazards are only one factor that influences future risks. The other factors are the extent of exposure, the vulnerability of the exposed population, and the capacity of individuals and communities to prepare for and manage heatwaves. There is growing literature that sensitivity to heatwaves has declined over recent decades, presumably because of some degree of acclimatization to ever higher temperatures, increasing access to air conditioning and cooling centers, better understanding and communication of the risks of high ambient temperatures, and changing infrastructure to reduce urban heat islands.  Recent projections using different approaches that take these changes into account show that taking these factors into account decreases the magnitude of risks. 	
“Those who seek to help should keep the bigger picture in mind.”	Exactly Mr Lomborg. That’s why focusing on a small component of the story, in an area where many competing forces mask the underlying signal, is such a narrow approach. If one looks at the big picture of climate change, the loss of ice and snow, the increasing high temperature extremes, the already-apparent effects of sea level rise around the globe, the urgency of the problem becomes crystal-clear.	article38.txt
“Earlier this month, NASA scientists provided a visualization of a startling climate change trend — the Earth is getting greener, as viewed from space, especially in its rapidly warming northern regions. And this is presumably occurring as more carbon dioxide in the air, along with warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons, makes plants very, very happy.”	The point in the second sentence may be true for areas where longer growing seasons and warmer temperatures do increase productivity, but it is likely false for vast other regions of the world where lack of moisture will outweigh positive impacts of global change on growth. So this sentence right off the bat gives a bit of a misrepresentation by being worded in a way that can be construed as applying globally not just in the far north. Also there is nothing “startling” about this trend – it is exactly as hypothesized for such regions.	article28.txt
“This means a region of the north Atlantic is becoming relatively cool and this exaggerates the contrast with tropical waters to the south, which is the driver for storms. In the worst case scenario, said the renowned climate scientist Prof James Hansen, this ‘will drive superstorms, stronger than any in modern times – all hell will break loose in the north Atlantic and neighbouring lands’.”	I agree that the superstorm suggestion is very speculative. In one paper we looked at a similar scenario and saw a clear increase in the number of storms, but not their intensity, though that was just in one climate model. Brayshaw and Woollings (2009) Tropical and Extratropical Responses of the North Atlantic Atmospheric Circulation to a Sustained Weakening of the MOC, Journal of Climate 	
I note particularly that sea-level rise is not affected by the warming; it continues at the same rate, 1.8 millimeters a year, according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr.	This claim is against the basic laws of physics—warming causes thermal expansion of sea water and thereby sea-level rise, full stop. This is true regardless of whether this effect can be detected in a cherry-picked short time interval with poor data quality.	article99.txt
“suggest that residents are fleeing atolls swiftly sinking into the sea. Yet new research shows that this is not the entire—or even an accurate—picture.” 	Scientists’ comments on this article clearly show that it is also not an “entire” or “accurate” picture. So Mr. Lomborg is using the very flawed reasoning he is condemning others of.	
“unprecedented droughts nearly everywhere food is today produced”	Actually, overall the general projection is for the world to be wetter on average, with increasing drought in some regions but decreases in others, and increased annual rainfall in many places. The projections are extremely uncertain though, so while it is probably possible to cherry-pick model simulations that suggest increased drought in almost any region (and hence argue, probably fairly, that most places do have some increased risk of drought) these would not be expected to happen concurrently everywhere. A scenario with increased drought in one region would generally see a decrease elsewhere.	
“climate economists see a positive externality, not a negative one, from the human influence on climate. (In technical lingo, the so-called social cost of carbon would be negative.)”	The present calculations of the “social cost of carbon” tend to be bottom up and so include only those costs that one can reasonably quantify. As a result many types of impacts are simply left out of the calculation, like the cost of losing the culture of an island nation that is swamped, the impacts of ocean acidification and biodiversity loss, the actual social cost of climate change (e.g., of the New England climate becoming that of the Southeast, Sweden like Spain, etc.)…	article36.txt
“global warming causes about as much damage as benefits.”	The studies of the aggregate economic impacts from global warming synthesized in the last IPCC (Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change) do not support the claim that benefits from climate change counterbalance the costs. All but one study find net costs, and the study finding aggregate benefits at the global level is focusing on a very low warming (+1°C). Since the IPCC assessment report, new studies have evaluated economic costs and benefits from climate change. Notably, Burke et al 2015 (Global non-linear effect of temperature on economic production) do find some net benefits for a limited number of countries, but at the global level the net economic effect corresponds to costs.	article27.txt

They concluded that trends toward rising climate damages were mainly due to increased population and economic activity in the path of storms, that it was not currently possible to determine the portion of damages attributable to greenhouse gases, and that they didn’t expect that situation to change in the near future.	This is true, but it is only one of 20 conclusions from the Hohenkammer Statement. Another conclusion, for example, is: “For future decades the IPCC (2001) expects increases in the occurrence and/or intensity of some extreme events as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Such increases will further increase losses in the absence of disaster reduction measures.”	article128.txt
Dr. Schmidt also denied that there was any ‘pause’ or ‘hiatus’ in global warming between the 1998 and 2015 El Ninos.”	If you want to cherry pick 1998 as the beginning year—a year in which the temperature was high due to El Niño—it would at least be fair to stop in 2016, not 2015, because 2016 is the year that the temperatures were highest due to El Niño. If you do so, there is clearly no “slowdown”. Better would be not to cherry-pick a specific period. The long-term trend is clearly warming and statistics do not indicate any decline in the warming rate. Since 2016, I would argue you no longer need statistics to see this. Just look at the complete graph.	
“[CO2] is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature.”	While the presence of CO2 has warmed the atmosphere to “habitable” temperatures, the additional increase of it will bring temperatures way outside habitable ranges in many regions including the oceans, as well as disturbing the water cycle and acidifying the oceans.	
If warming temperatures brought on by greenhouse gas emissions make wet years less wet and dry years even drier, as scientists anticipate, year-to-year recovery will become more difficult.	Climate warming is expected to create intensification of the hydrologic cycle here as well, meaning that heaviest annual rainfall events may become more intense. So, overall—less rain, but the large storms will be even larger and create flash floods.	article100.txt
In its 5th assessment report in 2013, the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010. But it means a chunk of the rise is coming from elsewhere.	The relevant finding is: “It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period.” (My italicisation.) The reporter has picked up a commonly used trick to quote just the first sentence of the key finding. The full finding clearly falsifies the assertion here. The best estimate remains that all the warming seen since the mid-20th Century is down to us.	
“At a cost of between $1 trillion and $2 trillion annually, the Paris climate agreement, recently ratified by China, is likely to be history’s most expensive treaty. It will slow the world’s economic growth to force a shift to inefficient green energy sources.”	There are hundreds of corporations who have signed on to reducing emissions in their own best interest (e.g. Walmart, DuPont, Chevron, Johnson and Johnson, Mercedes Benz, Dow… consult the White House website for an expanded list), reducing emissions and helping their customers do the same, for the benefit of their bottom line and their employees and their shareholders. These companies know that they will make money working to reduce their carbon emissions (being first to get there). Their gains are not recognized by Bjorn’s cost estimates. This is not to say that it is free. It is to say that Bjorn’s Holy Grail of cost-benefit analysis should include the enormous deductions to costs from the market. 	article38.txt
‘Although some researchers doubted the existence of a global warming hiatus because of coverage bias, artificial inconsistency, and a change point analysis of instrumental Ts records,’ a just-published study at Nature.com’s Scientific Reports found, ‘it is now accepted that a recent warming deceleration can be clearly observed.’ ”	…which has been truncated by several years of record temperatures increases—on top of previous record warmth. This is the superposition of a forced trend on top of natural variability. The cherry-picking of time series to prove that the Earth isn’t warming due to anthropogenic influence is a classic climate change contrarian tactic.	
“More than half of the 44 studies selected for publication found that raised levels of CO2 had little or no impact on marine life, including crabs, limpets, sea urchins and sponges” 	This is meaningless… it is not unexpected that several papers published in the issue showed little or no impact because the call for papers specifically welcomed such contributions. The bias is therefore very high. I recommend using the unbiased dataset investigated by Kroeker et al. (2013). It does demonstrate negative impacts on some processes and groups of organisms. Kroeker K. et al., 2013. Impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms: quantifying sensitivities and interaction with warming. Global Change Biology 19:1884-1896. 	
“Last year’s warmth was manifested across the planet, from the warm tropical ocean waters off the coast of northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef experienced its worst coral bleaching event on record and large scale coral death, to the Arctic, where sea ice hit regular monthly record lows and overall temperatures were also the warmest on record, at least from January through September 2016.”	The article overlooks the fact that not only was the bleaching on the northern Great Barrier Reef the worst on record, so was the bleaching in many areas around the world. In fact, the global coral bleaching event that is still underway is the longest, most widespread, and perhaps most damaging event on record. 	article46.txt
“If our climate conversation managed to include the good along with the bad, we would have a much better understanding of our options.”	True, but the author should set the example and have a balanced view here, showing the bad along with the good. Something he dramatically failed to do. 	article27.txt
“cold kills many more people than heat.”	Lomborg seems unaware of, or more likely is ignoring, the fact that climate change caused by human activities is making the climate not only warmer but more unpredictable: increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events including drought, heavy downpours, heat waves… 	article25.txt
But it is part of a long list of studies from independent teams (as this interactive graphic shows), using a variety of methods that take account of critical challenges, all of which conclude that climate models exhibit too much sensitivity to greenhouse gases.	While several groups have indeed done this calculation, and they all get the same answer, these groups are basically doing versions of the same calculation with the same data. Thus, their agreement means much, much less than is suggested here. If there is a problem with the methodology, which several recently published papers have suggested, then all of them are wrong.	article103.txt
“Previous satellite estimates of modern ice losses tried to take this into account, but precise new GPS data showed much of Greenland is rising far more rapidly than thought, up to 12mm a year. This means 19 cubic kilometres more ice is falling into the sea each year, an increase of about 8% on earlier figures.”	It might be worth noting that only some satellite estimates need to take this into account. Especially gravity-based mass change recoveries will be impacted while elevation-change or input/output methods will not. Projects like IMBIE intercompare different methods to build consensus among them. 	article35.txt
“this event poses severe risks to health — particularly for children and the elderly […] an extreme 2003 heat wave that affected Paris and Europe, and which has indeed been connected to climate change through statistical attribution analysis […] killed hundreds of people in Paris and London, and a recent study attributed at least some of those deaths, themselves, to climate change.”	Only mentioning the deaths in two cities understates the danger of heat waves. The number of people who died in the 2003 heat wave is estimated to be in the tens of thousands. This article estimates it was 70 thousand additional deaths.	
“cold kills many more people than heat.”	This is cherry picking – even if it were true. Climate change is much more than just temperature. It also affects precipitation and the lack thereof – with consequences such as floods, mud slides, droughts, and wildfires. Furthermore, the cold is fairly limited to the high northern latitudes, … and not so many live there, but many more in the warm tropics… These rich countries also have the means to collect statistics. The poor developing countries often lack credible statistics, and I do not believe for a second that we have an estimate of all people who die from heat stress in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.	article25.txt
” ‘You’ve only got to look at Singapore. It’s two-and-a-half times higher than the worst-case scenario for climate change, and it’s one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in.’ ”	There is a study by Cannaby and colleagues from the UK Met Office on sea-level rise around Singapore*. They talk about vulnerable regions within 2 m of the sea level, and find a ‘worst-case’ sea-level rise of 0.74 ± 0.29 m by 2100, so I’d say this statement is not correct.

Globally there’s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods. Some regions experience more, some less and some no trend. Limitations of data and inconsistencies in patterns prevent confident claims about global trends one way or another. There’s no trend in U.S. hurricane landfall frequency or intensity. If anything, the past 50 years has been relatively quiet. There’s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S. Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally. Since 1965, more parts of the U.S. have seen a decrease in flooding than have seen an increase. And from 1940 to today, flood damage as a percentage of GDP has fallen to less than 0.05 per cent per year from about 0.2 per cent.	This is more or less a summary of the data cited in Pielke’s presentation and probably accurate. But as mentioned above, it does not give the whole picture. (1) The observational data for the US does not reflect changes in other regions. Heat waves in other regions can, for example, already be linked to climate change: “It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale. It is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human influence has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations. (IPCC1) (2) The main argument for linking extreme weather with climate change comes from climate projections, which are completely omitted here. The IPCC special report on the 1.5 degree target2 is very clear in stating that a global warming of 2 degrees will lead to more extreme events than global warming of 1.5 degrees: “Climate models project robust differences in regional climate between present-day and global warming up to 1.5°C, and between 1.5°C and 2°C (high confidence), depending on the variable and region in question (high confidence). Large, robust and widespread differences are expected for temperature extremes (high confidence).” and “Limiting global warming to 1.5°C would limit risks of increases in heavy precipitation events on a global scale and in several regions compared to conditions at 2°C global warming (medium confidence). ” These are only summary statements, but detailed elaboration is given within the report. 1 – IPCC (2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis 2 – IPCC (2018) Global Warming of 1.5 °C 	article128.txt
“precipitation from global warming will make the world much greener”	This is highly uncertain. The CO2 and precipitation trends will also be accompanied by increasing temperatures and increasing drought, which is likely to harm vegetation. The balance of these factors is still unclear. 	article27.txt
I chose to assess the sea-level trend from 1915-45	This is a blatant case of cherry picking to confirm a Singer’s position while ignoring all other instrumental sea level data that may contradict that position. This fallacy is a major problem in public debate. 	article99.txt
“The Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than at any time for years.”	This is not per se completely incorrect, but the author does not tell us the whole story. The author refers to the growing of the ice sheet volume through snowfall throughout winter. The snow accumulated on Greenland in past winter (September-April) has indeed been remarkably high: However, this does not imply that the volume of the ice sheet is increasing, because (1) the ice sheet also loses ice through discharging icebergs; it is the difference between snowfall-driven growth and solid ice discharge that determines if the ice sheet gains or loses volume, and (2) the snow that accumulated during the winter will (at least partly) melt over the summer. That’s why we analyse changes to the ice sheet volume/mass on (at least) annual time scales. Only after the summer we will know how much of the accumulated snow has (not) been melted. uring the past years, the amount of melting has been record-high, and much of snow that accumulated over the winter melted and ran off into the ocean. Concurrently, ice discharge continued, so the Greenland ice sheet LOST considerable volume. We will know in September how much the ice sheet has changed volume this year. Two additional remarks: (a) The word “faster” should not have been used here. We are not talking about the rate of speed, but rather about the total change in volume. Also, it is easier to talk about “mass changes” than “volume changes” since the former is not sensitive to the density of the medium we are talking about (snow has a lower density than ice!). (b) The enhanced snowfall, ironically, is most probably also a signal of the strongly warming Arctic: as the atmosphere warms, it contains more moisture, and generates more precipitation. Also, record-low fall and winter sea ice extent led to large streaks of open water that might have contributed to additional moisture loading of the air.	article60.txt
But it is part of a long list of studies from independent teams (as this interactive graphic shows), using a variety of methods that take account of critical challenges, all of which conclude that climate models exhibit too much sensitivity to greenhouse gases.	Cherry pick much? For a better perspective, refer to the recent comprehensive literature review by Knutti et al*, which shows ECS estimates from a wide range of methodologies (see figures below). Notably, energy budget estimates are consistently biased low relative to other lines of evidence. Knutti et al (2017) Beyond equilibrium climate sensitivity, Nature Geoscience 	article103.txt
More than 100 climate models over the past 30 years did not predict what actually happened because it was assumed carbon dioxide had the pivotal role in driving climate change and that the effects of clouds, back-radiation and the sun were trivial.	Climate model projections from decades ago accurately predicted: (1) global warming would happen, (2) it would happen faster at high latitudes, (3) the HQadley Cell circulation would expand poleward, (4) the stratosphere would cool, (5) Arctic sea ice would retreat, (6) convective cloud tops in the tropics would get higher. These changes have all now been measured. For example, a 1988 study1 discussed rising convective cloud tops. And a 2016 study2 showed it was measured with satellites. 1-Wetherald and Manabe (1988) Cloud Feedback Processes in a General Circulation Model, Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences 2-Norris et al (2016) Evidence for climate change in the satellite cloud record, Nature	
“we should look at all the available information.”	Yes indeed, this is exactly what the IPCC does. I agree with Lomborg that having unbalanced views, only showing negative outcomes, is not helpful. But this is also true for this article that attempts to only show positive outcomes. Planet will get greener, less people will die in winter, the developed world is less vulnerable, precipitation will increase … All of these statements are severely biased, only telling half of the story (if not less…).	article27.txt
“‘With levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere consistently breaking new records, the influence of human activities on the climate system has become more and more evident,’ said Taalas.”	Readers should also be aware of the decades-long lag between the stabilization of CO2 in the atmosphere and the stabilization of CO2-induced warming. The planet will continue to heat because ocean temperatures will not yet be in equilibrium with the atmosphere.	
“Then it will destroy all the species that depend on it — causing an almighty mass extinction which will wipe out the fishing industry and turn our oceans into a barren zone of death.”	That is not a truthful summary of the scientific literature. Check, for example, the meta-analysis of Kroeker et al. (2013) who describe processes and organisms that do not seem to be affected by ocean acidification. Kroeker et al. (2013) Impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms: quantifying sensitivities and interaction with warming. Global Change Biology. 	article45.txt
“In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.”	Most work on studying the dynamics of greenhouse gas balance in degrading permafrost systems, both as based on field measurements and as represented in ecosystem models for making climate feedback projections, seems to point to methane release being a relatively minor pathway for permafrost carbon to be released to the atmosphere, at least for terrestrial permafrost sources (which comprise most of the carbon mentioned here). It is true that terrestrial permafrost systems emit methane, but most of that methane is from recently photosynthesized carbon rather than older permafrost sources, and most of the carbon released from the older permafrost sources is released as either carbon dioxide or dissolved organic carbon rather than methane. So, while uncertainty on this issue remains high, and permafrost thaw is a potentially strong feedback process, this feedback seems likely to be dominated by carbon dioxide rather than methane. A specifically misleading thing about these numbers, which are a metric called “global warming potential”, is that their units are based on the mass of the gas. Since the question here is whether a given atom of carbon will be emitted to the atmosphere contained within either a molecule of carbon dioxide or a molecule of methane, you have to take into account the fact that the molecule of carbon dioxide is much heavier, because of the two oxygen atoms it picks up in the transformation to that gas, versus the four hydrogen atoms it would acquire in becoming methane. What this means in practice is that you have to divide the global warming potential by the ratio of the weight of the molecules, which is 44/16 or 2.75. So strictly speaking, the 34 and 86 ought to read 12 and 31. This is a separate issue from the timescale one that others point out, and which further makes this comparison misleading.	
“Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.”	This may be a bit of a misrepresentation, as precision is only one part of the story here. The length of the available records is also crucial—hence the need for studies of tide gauge data.	article93.txt
“[Sea ice] also helps regulate the planet’s temperature by influencing the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean. It can affect weather in the U.S.”	Sea ice acts as an insulating blanket over the Arctic Ocean and by removing it (via our impact on the climate) we are “performing the largest experiment in oceanography”, allowing the winds and atmosphere to directly interact with the Arctic Ocean and therefore potentially waking up the “sleeping Arctic Ocean” both mechanically and thermodynamically. (See the Lunch Hour Lecture at University College London below.) 	
Our evolving dynamic planet has survived sea level changes of hundreds of metres	That is really nice for that rock revolving around the Sun. I personally also care about the people and communities living in coastal cities and towns and their cultural heritage. Ian Plimer can naturally have another opinion on their value.	
People who study the impacts of global warming have found that if ECS is low — say, less than two — then the impacts of global warming on the economy will be mostly small and, in many places, mildly beneficial.	This is not necessarily true, as the amount of future warming depends as much on future emissions trajectories as it does on climate sensitivity. A world with 1000 ppm CO2 and an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 2 would still be quite unpleasant.	article103.txt
“In the worst-case scenario, this research suggests, the rate of sea-level rise could reach a foot per decade by the 22nd century, about 10 times faster than today.”	We published the results of a study in Science Advances last year (Winkelmann et al., 2015; Combustion of available fossil fuel resources sufficient to eliminate the Antarctic Ice Sheet) concluding that in a worst case scenario, sea level could be rising at an average rate of a foot per decade, averaged over the next 1000 years. Our model, however, did not include the mechanical instability of ice sheet cliffs considered by DeConto and Pollard (2016; Contribution of Antarctica to past and future sea-level rise), which could potentially result in sea-level rises of this magnitude. A key word here is ‘could’. More work needs to be done to assess the likelihood of this occurrence, but sea-level rise rates of a foot per decade by year 2100 appear to be a real risk posed by our greenhouse gas emissions.	article34.txt
“ ‘Although some researchers doubted the existence of a global warming hiatus because of coverage bias, artificial inconsistency, and a change point analysis of instrumental Ts records,’ a just-published study at Nature.com’s Scientific Reports found, ‘it is now accepted that a recent warming deceleration can be clearly observed.’ ”	This article in Scientific American provides context left out by the author on the scientific debate over the warming “hiatus.” By cherry-picking only this line from a single study, the author misrepresents the painstaking process of data analysis and hypothesis testing that led to that conclusion. As the Scientific American article points out, the authors of the study cited by the author were confident in reporting their findings—which do not refute the existence of anthropogenic global warming—because science exists to challenge previous work and is constantly incorporating new information that may alter previous conclusions, a fact which undercuts the author’s claims repeated throughout his article that climate science is a politically-motivated house of cards.	
“The changes in the amount of oxygen in the shells isn’t a reflection of changing temperatures – just a consequence of the fact that the amount of oxygen seen changes over time anyway.”	It doesn’t just change over time anyway. Firstly, we are talking about the isotope ratio of oxygen, not the amount. Secondly, the authors show evidence that in some depositional settings this sort of “resetting” of temperatures could occur. By over-simplifying here the author of the article loses and obscures the original study. 	
Let’s find out by comparing the actual temperatures since 1979 with what the 32 families of climate models used in the latest U.N. report on climate science predicted they would be.	Considering a larger range of time, Marotzke and Forster (2015)1 generally find good consistency between models and observations. 1- Martozke and Forster (2015) Forcing, feedback and internal variability in global temperature trends, Nature	article130.txt
“Others have argued that the records were caused by El Nino […] The new fall in temperatures suggests they were right.”	Incorrect. We have seen more than 1°C of warming which is largely due to human activities. The strong El Niño has added around 0.1°C temporarily. Therefore, the largest cause of the record temperatures is human activities.	
“Stress from unusually warm ocean water heated by man-made climate change and the natural El Niño climate pattern caused the die-off.”	Roughly speaking, the El Niño may have added a quarter of a degree C to the global average in 2015/16, while the greenhouse-gas-related warming trend has added twice that much to the average values since the 1980s. It’s also important to note that this is only one part of a global coral bleaching event that has been occurring since mid-2014. NOAA declares third ever global coral bleaching event 	article42.txt
A well-known statistical distribution derived from modeling studies summarizes the uncertainties in this method. It shows that ECS is probably between two and 4.5 degrees, possibly as low as 1.5 but not lower, and possibly as high as nine degrees.	Uncertainty is not our friend. The fact that the different methods and studies do not fully agree should not be taken as an argument to pick one particular number that one happens to like and discard all the other evidence. As an analogy, when suddenly fog appears on a narrow windy road and the obstacles are hard to see, the normal reaction would be to slow down to be on the safe side, not to accelerate. Greater uncertainty in future warming should be an argument to prepare for the worst case, not to hope for the unlikely case that the impacts will be benign.	article103.txt
“Using paleoclimatic data, studies suggest sea ice is shrinking to levels not seen in thousands of years.”	The relevant assessment from the latest IPCC report (Chapter 5 Information from Paleoclimate Archives) is: “There is medium confidence from reconstructions that the current (1980–2012) summer sea ice retreat was unprecedented and sea surface temperatures in the Arctic were anomalously high in the perspective of at least the last 1450 years. Lower than late 20th century summer Arctic sea ice cover is reconstructed and simulated for the period between 8000 and 6500 years ago in response to orbital forcing.” 	article47.txt
“Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years. If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet, are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade?”	Proxy analysis has clearly shown an acceleration in rate of sea-level rise. Our research* found that the rate of sea-level rise on the US Atlantic coast is greater now than at any time in the past 2,000 years. The research also shows a consistent link between global mean surface temperature and changes in sea level for the past millennium. The study shows that after relatively subtle changes in temperature and sea-level rise over the last 2,000 years, the rate of sea-level rise increased in the late 19th century. Sea-level rise contributes significantly to the frequency of flooding from hurricanes. The contribution from sea-level rise to flood height works in together with other factors such as timing of the storm relative to high tide, and the strength and direction of individual hurricanes. Sea-level rise between hurricanes raises the “baseline” water level and makes flooding more likely. We published another paper* showing that New York City can expect nine-foot floods, as intense as that produced by 2012’s Superstorm Sandy, at least four times more frequently over the next century. We report that floods as intense as Sandy’s would have occurred about once every 400 years on average under present day sea-level rise conditions, but that over the 21st century are expected to be about four times more probable (once every 100 years) due to an acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise.

“ever since December temperatures in the Arctic have consistently been lower than minus 20 C”	It is indeed true that the Arctic is cold in winter—it’s hard to argue with that. But this statement belies the fact that winter 2017 was actually extraordinarily warm by historical standards, and second only to the record-shattering warmth observed just last year (in 2016). The attached plot, created by Zachary Labe and available at http://sites.uci.edu/zlabe/arctic-temperatures, shows that the -20 °C temperatures this winter are nearly 10 °C degrees above the long-term average of -30 °C! Therefore, the fact that temperatures were -20 °C this winter in the Arctic is actually a testament to just how much the Arctic has warmed in recent years.	
There’s no trend in global droughts. Cold snaps in the U.S. are down but, unexpectedly, so are heatwaves.	Yes, but not in other regions of the world (see annotations above).	article128.txt
“Peter Wadhams, professor of ocean physics at the University of Cambridge, predicted ‘global disaster’ from the demise of Arctic sea ice—in four years. He too, is eating crow.”	These predictions of Peter Wadhams have been opposed by all climate scientists I know of. This picking of quotes that are convenient for Robert Bradley Jr.’s narrative while ignoring what most climate scientists say is one of his most used rhetorical tools.	
“Sea level rise is global. But due to a variety of factors – including, for this part of the Atlantic coast, a likely weakening of the Gulf Stream, itself potentially a result of the melting of Greenland’s ice caps – south Floridians are feeling the effects more than many others. While there has been a mean rise of a little more than 3mm per year worldwide since the 1990s, in the last decade, the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually.”	True: Sea-level rise in Florida is the result of a variety of factors. But the influence of a weakening Gulf Stream will be felt more in the northeast of the US than Florida. Furthermore, land level subsidence due to glacial isostatic adjustment is less in Florida than the mid and northeast Atlantic. With respect to melting from Greenland, yes, Florida will feel a greater impact than regions to the North. But the rate of rise will be less than the global average. Focusing on the last decade and one tide gauge could be considered cherry-picking the data. Long-term (>60yrs) tide gauges should be used. Virginia Key has only been operational since 1994. Key West Tide gauge has been operational since 1901 and records a rate of sea-level rise of 2.37 mm/yr. 	article56.txt
“We indicated 23 years ago — in our 1994 Nature article — that climate models had the atmosphere’s sensitivity to CO2 much too high,” Christy said in a statement. “This recent paper bolsters that conclusion.”	This 23 years is likely where the mistake in the title comes from. Although the data in this Christy and McNider article from 1994 turned out to have major errors, for example not taking into account that the satellites drift, which caused the underestimation of the warming, it started the tradition of Christy and McNider being overconfident about the reliability of their data (“perhaps the best measurements of the Earth’s air temperature in terms of its global coverage and precision.”). And the tradition of immediately blaming climate models, ignoring many other independent lines of evidence on warming and climate sensitivity, when there can be many other reasons for the difference between their data and climate models. In this 1994 paper, Christy and McNider’s data showed almost no warming. In that respect one could say that 23 years of removing errors from the satellite temperature data has accelerated upper air warming.	
“Instead of negotiating over climate change policies and trying to make them more market-oriented, some political conservatives have taken the approach of blocking them by trying to undermine the science.”	On the scientific community side, the consensus is broad. It’s worth revisiting Cook et al. 2015*. In their review they find a 97% consensus about human-induced global warming in published climate studies.

“The UN has already said that 2016 is highly likely to break the annual record again, after 14 straight months of extreme heat aided by a hefty El Niño climatic event, a weather event that typically raises temperatures around the world.“	I would say that it increases ‘global mean temperature’. An El Niño does not necessarily imply warming everywhere on Earth. Also, especially pronounced are the warm conditions in the Arctic, which are not explicitly mentioned here, but do not relate to the strong El Niño.	article31.txt
since 1979 to the most reliable observations — those made by satellites and weather balloons over the vast tropics. 	Beware of cherry-picking: It is not established that satellites are the “most reliable” observations, that the tropics are the best domain with which to compare observations or models, or that we should only consider post-1979 satellite era data.	article130.txt
“ It has now, even after Hurricane Matthew, been over 4,000 days since a major hurricane (Category 3 or stronger) has made landfall in the U.S. ”	The definition of US major hurricane landfall is strict but also arbitrary, and isn’t a particularly good measure of coastal risk. The threshold of a major hurricane, and the restriction that the center of a hurricane must move over land is somewhat ad hoc and may obfuscate the points of relevance. For example, many coastal communities have experienced major hurricane landfalls over the past 4,000 days. They just don’t happen to be within the geopolitical border of the contiguous US. Matthew is in fact a good example for why the author’s statement is misleading. Matthew did a great deal of damage as a major hurricane without technically having its center touch land. The fact that it didn’t make formal landfall as a major hurricane is not particularly relevant when considering coastal hazard exposure and human mortality risk. 	
The second big adjustment was over the Arctic Ocean	This is not an adjustment. Some temperature datasets did not include parts of the Arctic in their estimates of the global mean temperature. Because the Arctic warmed much in this period, these datasets showed less short-term warming. This was taken into account in their uncertainty estimates, which should have been taken into account by people wrongly claiming global warming had stopped between 2000 and 2014.	article130.txt
“This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with climatologists and researchers in related fields”	This sentence implies, somehow, that the scientific content of this article comes from these scientists, or that they agree with it. I don’t believe that this is entirely the case—e.g. see Michael Mann’s comments—and, the author should have mentioned that as a caveat here.
